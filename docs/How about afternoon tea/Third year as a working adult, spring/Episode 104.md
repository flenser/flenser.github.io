Episode 104: Because I thought I'd like to take loads of photos of Yui-san

The next morning.

I awoke to Yui-san shaking my shoulder — someone who normally wouldn’t rise before me.

“Kanata, good morning. It’s morning already.”

Her voice held a special sweetness reserved only for lovers, and the gentle press of her lips against my forehead made me slowly lift my eyelids.

After several blinks, I brought my focus to Yui-san looking down at me.\
　The Yui captured in my vision was smiling — not a trace of yesterday's unease remained, her expression utterly cloudless.

Rubbing my eyes, I headed to the living room. Breakfast was already laid out on the dining table.\
I'd wanted to prepare it for her on a day like this, but I'd been a step too slow. I felt a pang of regret.

We sat facing each other and said, "Let's eat." Gentle spring sunlight filtered softly through the lace curtains.

"Come to think of it, Kanata, your birthday's coming up soon. Is there anything you'd like this year?"

Nibbling on freshly toasted bread, generously soaked in butter, I looked up at Yui-san across from me.

As ever, Yui-san switches gears so quickly and effortlessly. Smiling brightly, she seemed completely back to her usual self, as if yesterday's shadow had been a lie.\
　Yesterday's Yui-san was demure and utterly adorable, but honestly, I always want you to be smiling.

I swallowed the bread and gazed at Yui-san.

"...This year, I do. Just yesterday, I thought of something I'd really like."

"Oh, really? What is it?"

"I'd like a camera."

"A camera?"

"Yes. When we go travelling together, I want to take loads of photos of you."

I wanted to capture and preserve countless everyday moments from now on. And I wanted to fill this living room with photos, filling it to the brim with countless memories.

"I see, a camera. That's nice. It sounds like it could be a lovely hobby."

Yui-san said that and smiled happily.

I wanted to capture that gentle gaze she gave me in a photograph.\
　Whether a complete amateur could handle a camera well — well, I'd think about that after she bought it for me.

I saw Yui off to the front door, dressed in her immaculate, wrinkle-free suit.\
With the directors' meeting today, Yui was heading straight to the parent company's building, so I couldn't go with her.\
Yet, strangely, my heart felt calm. Because I knew there was no more hesitation in her eyes.

"I'll be late today... Go home first and wait here,"

Yui said as she put on her shoes. I nodded vigorously.

"Right then, I'll be off."

"Yes... Take care, Yui."

No more words were needed.

Simply, as if layering our feelings, I pressed my lips to hers, laden with tenderness.\
　A kiss that lasted far longer than usual, simply touching.

Leaving home a little after Yui-san, I too set out.\
Alighting at the station nearest my office, I walked my commute with a brightened heart.\
The leaves of the verdant street trees shimmered, swaying in the soft spring breeze.

It would soon be a year since joining Yui-san's company. So many things have happened since then. Listing them all would be endless.

Who could have imagined such a reunion, which felt like nothing short of divine mischief?

No one knows what the future holds.

But no matter how dire the circumstances, simply being together, side by side, made us incredibly, immeasurably happy.

So it'll be alright. Tonight, Yui will surely come home with a smile.

I shall wait for her at that house. And when she returns, I resolved to hold her as tightly as I possibly could today.

＊＊＊

The president's office, empty. I trace Yui-san's desk gently with my fingertips.

The board meeting starts at ten. Afterwards, Yui-san is scheduled to have a meal with her father and Yukiyasu-san.

　Given it was the day all the group's subsidiary presidents gathered, today should have been a peaceful one.

Naturally, I hadn't scheduled anything, so no one should have come here.\
All employees should know today is the 'Presidents' Meeting', so the internal line in this room shouldn't ring.

Yet, when the familiar ringtone suddenly sounded, I startled and looked up.

　The red light on the landline phone flashed intermittently.

I immediately realised what that extension call meant. Swallowing hard, I gently picked up the receiver from my own desk.

"...Yes, this is Aosawa, the secretary."

If there was anyone who might have business here today — there could only be one person.

　When I went to reception, he was waiting for me, his eyes bloodshot and sweat beading on his forehead.\
Wada-san at reception looked troubled, flustered as she glanced back and forth between us.

　I looked straight at Kitakami-san. His expression was desperate, showing no sign of composure; his hair was dishevelled, as if he'd rushed here.\
The mask that usually clung to his face had already fallen away, leaving no trace.

"Kitakami-san, thank you for your continued support. The president is unavailable today, however."

I delivered the standard phrase. He spat out, "I know that."

"I came to see you, not Yui. I have business with you."

"I see. I'm afraid I'm rather busy today. Might you please take your leave?"

When I stated it plainly, Kitakami-san narrowed his eyes and glared at me.

I have no need to speak with you. Besides, the directors' meeting should have started by now. Once that begins, he won't be able to interfere.

　The gears had begun turning.

Kitakami-san was a close aide to Yui's father. Perhaps — perhaps he'd heard from Yui's father today that he was going out to dinner with Yukiyasu.\
That must be why he'd rushed over here, to me.

"This won't take long. It's urgent. It has to be today."

Grabbing my arm forcefully, Kitakami-san yanked me towards him. His large, powerful hands pulled me so forcefully my body swayed.

I frowned, thinking he was being rather pushy.

I glanced at Wada-san, who looked troubled.\
Judging by the situation, Kitakami-san seemed quite angry — arguing here probably wasn't wise. Thinking this, I reluctantly let him pull my arm and followed him in silence.

　Where are we going? I wondered, only to be practically shoved onto the landing of the fire escape. I sighed.\
Not that I'd intended to sit down and talk properly, so it suited me, I suppose.

"...Kitakami-san, that hurts."

At that, he abruptly let go of my arm, as if brushing me off. I gently rubbed my upper arm, where the sensation of being grabbed lingered.

"I heard from President Ichinose. After the board meeting, he said he'd invited Yukiyasu and Yui out for dinner. She is going to tell them today, isn't she?"

"What are you talking about?"

"Don't play dumb. Stop Yui right now. Do you really understand what you're trying to do!?"

With veins bulging on his forehead, he shouted so loudly that I instinctively took a step back. My heel touched the edge of the staircase.

Just because hardly anyone uses the emergency staircase, shouting like that here meant Kitakami-san must be extremely panicked.

"...Yui admitted to her relationship with you that day. She said she'd pay whatever compensation I demanded. But in return, she made it crystal clear I was to have nothing more to do with her."

That day — Valentine's Day, then.

I bit my lip to stifle the urge to ask why he was here now. There was no point arguing with someone this worked up.

"But I won't accept that. Running a company isn't child's play. If your father weren't President Ichinose's close friend, I'd have sued you long ago."

I simply stared back at those burnt-brown eyes, clouded with anger, with a cold detachment.

"Still, if you insist you cannot step aside... let's call it a trade-off."

"A trade-off?"

"...I could serve as your cover. That should smooth things over. There'd be no need to inform President Ichinose about you two specifically."

"...What exactly does that mean?"

"It means I'll turn a blind eye to your relationship. However, I'll marry Yui. That's the condition. I won't budge on this."

I recalled what Yukiyasu-san had said.

This man couldn't believe in his own efforts, striving only to be what his father wanted him to be. He had no self. He could only become a puppet—a pitiful man.

"...Kitakami-san, are you truly content with that? A life spent merely running along a predetermined track, without a single ounce of your own effort being acknowledged?"

His face contorted as if struck. I knew full well it was something he didn't want to hear, yet I couldn't refrain from saying it.

"Don't you realise deep down, Kitakami-san? That nothing more needs to be said. If you wish to sue me, be my guest. I'm prepared to accept any punishment if it means being with Yui-san."

"...I see. I understand. You have no intention of accepting the terms, then."

I could see his clenched fist trembling violently with rage. Being intimidated by a man much larger than myself, I wasn't entirely without fear instinctively... but I said nothing, just stared back at him.

　With trembling fingers, he pulled a white envelope from his coat pocket. Then, without a word, he handed it to me.

"...What is this?"

I took it and opened the envelope. Inside were several photographs. At first glance, I froze in shock.

They showed me and Yui-san.

　A photo of us walking hand in hand, gazing at the illuminations. A photo of us laughing together over a meal in a hotel.\
In each, we were looking at each other, and it was immediately clear we shared a special bond.

These were from Christmas...

"...This is my final warning. If you have no intention of stopping Yui, then so be it. I don't know how President Ichinose will judge this, but if I don't get a satisfactory answer, I won't just quietly back down. I'll expose your relationship with Yui. This is no empty threat."

His voice was low, almost a growl, and I lifted my gaze from the photographs.\
His gaze was like a snake's – relentless, clinging, viscous. I gasped. It felt like something was coiling around my ankles, slowly tightening its grip. A suffocating, sickening sensation washed over me.

Now that my engagement to Yui is public knowledge, what do you think will happen if your relationship comes to light...? You understand, don't you? You might be alright. You could just resign from this company and that would be that. But what about Yui, who'll be thrown into the firing line? Having a fiancé yet committing adultery with your same-sex secretary. A major scandal. Naturally, it would cause a huge uproar.

My breathing grew shallow.

　Kitakami-san is serious. What should I do? I can't decide on the spot. I could feel cold sweat trickling down my back.

Should I contact Yui-san first? But she's in a meeting. So should I contact Yukiyasu-san instead?

But what good would stopping Yui-san do now? It's true Kitakami-san has leverage over me, but am I just going to keep obeying him, held hostage by his threats forever?

"You need only tell Yui to marry me. Then everything will continue as before, as if nothing ever happened."

No. I couldn't possibly stand by and watch Kitakami-san and Yui-san marry. I absolutely couldn't.

I couldn't possibly accept the conditions Kitakami-san was offering. Absolutely not!

Kitakami-san gave a faint, mocking laugh at my stunned silence.

"Such conditions... I can't accept them. There's no way I could."

"...Then there's only one thing left for me to do."

He turned on his heel. Could I really let Kitakami-san leave like this? No. I had to stop him.

"Kitakami-san, please wait—"

My frantically graping arm was pushed away. The momentum sent me off balance, and I fell backwards. Staggering, my foot that should have pulled back — failed to find the floor, kicking at thin air.

The instant I thought, "Eh?", my vision swayed. Only now did I remember. That I was standing on the edge of the stairs.

　Everything slowed, like slow motion. I saw Kitakami-san's eyes widen in shock. Instinctively, he reached out for me, but it was too late.

My body fell, head first.

Before I could comprehend what had happened, a fierce impact shook my body — and my consciousness snapped cleanly away.
