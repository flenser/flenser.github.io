Episode 107: Who Loves Who, Exactly?

I gaze up at the towering skyscraper, standing out conspicuously among the city's cluster of buildings, its structure soaring towards the blue sky. This is the headquarters building of the Holding company... truly the headquarters of one of Japan's largest conglomerates, I find myself gasping.

　On the top floor of this building, Yui-san's father and Kitakami-san were waiting.\
The realisation made a creeping sense of tension well up inside me.\
In stark contrast to my state, Yui-san was astonishingly composed.

"Come to think of it, I contacted Yuki-nii this morning too. Told him we'd be talking today."

"Eh? This morning?"

"Oh, was that not okay?"

"Oh, Yui-san, couldn't you have told me sooner? I mean, Yukiyasu-san went to all that trouble for us..."

"True. Well, we can just go and thank him properly another time."

Yui-san smiled as she said this.

The one-sided glass elevator shot upwards, sucking us towards the sky.\
　Yui-san stood with one hand in the pocket of her trouser suit, gazing out the window, looking quite relaxed.

Is Yui-san the type who performs well under pressure? She's probably been through more than I have, but I really think she's got nerves of steel.

The lift reached the top floor in no time, and I gulped nervously.\
My heart had been pounding annoyingly loudly since earlier.

"It's immediately left when you get off."

Following her instructions, we stepped out of the lift and turned left, where a heavy wooden door stood. The golden plaque above it, engraved with the words "President's Office", only heightened my tension.

"...It'll be alright, Kanata. Let's go."

Noticing my legs had gone to jelly, Yui gently placed her hand on my waist. Feeling the warmth of her touch, my heart gradually regained its calm.\
I took a deep breath. It's alright. Yui-san is here with me now.

When I knocked, President Ichinose's voice came from inside. Without hesitation, Yui-san turned the golden door handle, pushed open the heavy door, and stepped forward. I followed behind her.

　The large window of the president's office offered a sweeping view of Tokyo's cityscape. Bookshelves lined the walls, thick volumes neatly arranged.\
A stately wooden desk and a large, imposing sofa for receiving guests dominated the room.\
This room might easily be more than twice the size of Yui-san's own office.

President Ichinose, who had been gazing out the window, slowly turned to face us.\
　On the sofa, Kitakami-san sat with his hands clasped, head bowed. Noticing our entrance, he raised his gaze with a slow, deliberate movement.

He looked rather worn out. Dark circles had formed beneath his eyes, and his gaze lacked its usual vigour.

President Ichinose settled into the large leather desk chair and gave me a gentle smile.

"Kanata-chan, is your injury all right now?"

"I'm terribly sorry for causing you worry. I'm fine now."

"I see. That's good."

Feeling Kitakami-san's gaze, I looked at him. He awkwardly averted his eyes from mine.

I couldn't help wondering if he felt guilty, but it didn't matter now, so I looked away too.

"I've heard all the details from Shinji-kun and Yukiyasu. But I'd like to hear your feelings again, properly."

Yui-san took my hand and squeezed it firmly. There was no hesitation or uncertainty in her touch.

"...Three years ago, I asked Father to entrust me with running this company, promising I'd deliver results no matter what. It was because I wanted to prove I could manage without Shinji. And all of that was really just to break off my engagement with him."

"...You'd decided to do this so long ago?"

"Yes. At first, I intended to accept marrying Shinji. But... after meeting Kanata, I couldn't lie to myself anymore. I simply couldn't give up on Kanata. Without Kanata, my life has no meaning. ...So, please... please accept our relationship."

Yui-san's words made my eyes sting. Her intense feelings poured through our clasped hands.

　President Ichinose, who had been listening intently, nodding repeatedly as if savouring her words, then turned his gaze to me.

"...I understand Yui's feelings. I'll ask Kanata too, but you knew Yui was engaged to Shinji, didn't you? You knew all the risks, including the possibility of being sued?"

His calm voice felt like a stab to the softest part deep within my chest.\
　I knew Yui-san had a fiancé. Even so, I took her hand and threw myself into her arms.\
I understood it was unforgivable, every single bit of it.

"Yes. I'm prepared to take responsibility for my actions. But I fell for her so deeply, I couldn't stop myself, even knowing. ...I feel the same as Yui-san. I want to live with her, forevermore."

　I looked straight back into his eyes, the same colour as hers. There was no hesitation.

The thread of fate binding us together might have been too thin, too fragile.\
Yet Yui-san never gave up, continuing to pull us closer. Believing it would connect to the future someday.\
That's why we have now. That's why I can stand beside her.

I cannot let go of this hand again.

　President Ichinose took a deep breath, closed his eyes once, then exhaled deeply and slowly.

I knew from the start this wasn't something easily accepted.\
But. No matter how long it takes, I absolutely won't give up until you understand.

"Hmm, I see... All right."

It was the moment President Ichinose nodded deeply. A loud thud echoed through the room as a fist slammed down on a desk, making me turn towards the sound involuntarily.\
Kitakami-san rose abruptly, advancing towards President Ichinose's desk with a fierce expression.

"President Ichinose...! I simply cannot accept this! Not being able to marry, not being able to have children, two women wanting to be together – what utter nonsense is this!?"

　Kitakami-san pulled a photograph from his bosom and slammed it onto the desk. The sheer force of it overwhelmed me, making my shoulders jerk involuntarily.

"Look at this photograph! What would happen if someone saw them like this and it became public knowledge? The employees already know Yui has a fiancée... It would damage our credibility! And women together, of all things!!!"

　"It's known I have a fiancée"... But you were the one who deliberately exposed a relationship we hadn't made public. You just wanted to use Yui-san.

What's so wrong with two women loving each other?\
We're not causing trouble for anyone. We just wish to live with the person we love.

In stark contrast to Kitakami-san's torrent of words, President Ichinose remained utterly expressionless. He picked up the photograph slammed onto the desk and stared at it intently.

Yui-san said nothing, merely observing the two of them with an air of perfect composure.

"What is the most important thing for the group!? Yui has the responsibility to take over the company. Therefore, she should marry normally and have children. Isn't that right? This is surely just a momentary lapse of judgement. She'll come to her senses soon enough, realising such feelings are an illusion. President Ichinose, please make the right decision!"

"...The right decision... That stings."

　President Ichinose gave a wry smile and gently lifted his gaze from the photograph.\
Then, averting his eyes from Kitakami-san, he turned them towards Yui.

Noticing this, Yui quietly opened her mouth.

"...I won't marry Shinji. I'll pay proper compensation too. These past three years, I've done everything I could. If you still won't accept that, then I have no intention of taking over the company. I'll live with Kanata. I won't let anyone stand in our way."

"Eh?" I gasped, looking up at Yui in surprise. Not intending to take over the company? I hadn't imagined Yui would go that far.

If Yui refused to take over the company, Kitakami-san's goal – the very meaning of "marriage" itself – would become meaningless.

Kitakami-san turned back to Yui, looking stunned. His eyes widened, his lips trembled, and he was speechless.

　Amidst the tense atmosphere, President Ichinose suddenly let out a soft chuckle. Then, placing a hand on his forehead, he sighed deeply.

"Not taking over, eh? I see... Well, yes. You've never once been selfish before, so when you suddenly said you 'wanted to be president', I wondered what you were thinking... So that's what it was..."

　Though exasperated, President Ichinose narrowed his eyes, looking somehow pleased. It was a father's gaze, filled with deep affection.

"...It's no wonder Shinji-kun is angry. For eight years, you've devoted yourself entirely to our company. I won't forget that debt."

Kitakami-san, who had been staring blankly at Yui-san, slowly turned back towards President Ichinose. I couldn't tell what emotions he was feeling, but his shoulders trembled slightly.

"Your point is perfectly valid. But... given my daughter's wishes, as her father, I simply cannot force her into marriage. I truly am sorry. ...At the very least, I intend to make amends to the utmost extent possible."

President Ichinose bowed his head deeply, deeply to Kitakami-san.

　The taut tension eased, and I instinctively placed a hand over my still-pounding heart, exhaling a sigh of relief.\
Looking up at Yui, she too seemed relieved, her eyes crinkling as she smiled genuinely, radiating happiness.

Kitakami-san's shoulders shook violently, as if suppressing intense emotion. His fists were clenched so tightly the veins stood out, turning white.

"President Ichinose... I care about the Ichinose Group more than anyone. I'm the one who deserves her! I truly, from the bottom of my heart, love Yui!"

Just as Kitakami-san half-shouted this, the door suddenly burst open with a loud bang.

All eyes turned towards the door.

"Yui! Why didn't you tell me sooner, for goodness' sake!"

The one who suddenly burst into the president's office was Yukiyasu.

"I got caught in traffic, then they stopped me at reception... Honestly, you'd think they'd remember the face of the president's son."

"Yuki-nii, why..."

"I thought Shinji was probably just whingeing again, so I came to lend a hand."

Yukiyasu said this and grinned broadly.\
Kitakami stared at his face, utterly dumbfounded, as if he'd seen a ghost.

"Ah, is that the photo in question?"

Yukiyasu walked over to President Ichinose's desk, picked up the photo lying there, and peered at it.

"Well, it's beautifully taken. Shinji, you've got a knack for photography, don't you? Look, they both look incredibly happy."

Kitakami-san snatched the photo from Yukiyasu's laughing hand. He glared at Yukiyasu with bloodshot eyes.

"Yukiyasu, this doesn't concern you anymore. Don't stick your nose in now!"

"Yui's my sister. Of course it concerns me. Besides, I've got some pretty good stuff myself, actually."

Saying this, Yukiyasu ignored our stunned expressions and pulled a bundle of photos from his coat.\
Then, grinning cheerfully, he laid them out one by one on the desk.

"This one's Rika-chan, the nurse, right? This one's Miyako-chan from the girls' bar. And this girl here... what was her name again? There are too many to remember. Blimey, Shinji, you're popular, aren't you? You've got this many girlfriends? I'm jealous."

The blood drained instantly from Kitakami-san's face, which had been bright red, leaving him pale as a ghost.

　What photos could they be? Curious, I peered at Yukiyasu-san's hands. What he held was a pile of photographs showing Kitakami-san and an unfamiliar woman entering a hotel, their bodies pressed tightly together.

I gasped in shock.\
Of course — even though Yui-san wouldn't let him lay a finger on her, I'd suspected Kitakami-san couldn't possibly be without someone like that.

　President Ichinose grabbed one of the photos and stared at it silently.\
Though it wasn't hot, beads of sweat formed on Kitakami-san's forehead.

"So? Who loves who?"

Yukiyasu-san said this, narrowing his eyes and smiling brightly, his expression refreshingly cheerful.

"President Ichinose, it's not like that, this is...!"

"You're being stubborn. Shinji, you should just give up and gracefully step aside. There's no love between you, so this marriage is pointless. It's a case of both sides being at fault, right? Yui, you don't intend to demand compensation or anything, do you? I think it's absolutely better to break off the engagement cleanly, without any lingering issues."

"Yukiyasu, shut up!!!"

Kitakami flew into a rage and grabbed Yukiyasu by the lapels. Yukiyasu flung his arm away with all his might and glared at Kitakami with piercing eyes.

"Don't get too cocky, Shinji. You don't seriously think these are my only cards, do you? I could finish you off completely, including your father. I could make sure you never get back on your feet."

The moment his father's name was mentioned, Kitakami-san flinched slightly. Watching him suddenly go quiet and fall silent, Yukiyasu straightened the collar of his rumpled jacket.

"Yukiyasu, Shinji-kun, calm down. Shinji-kun, I certainly don't intend to blame you for this matter. Yui feels the same, doesn't she?"

Yui nodded once.

"We bear some responsibility here too. It's hardly fair to say this is in exchange for overlooking the matter, but would you please consider accepting the annulment of our engagement? If you do, I shall do my utmost to fulfil your wishes. You are a hard worker and a truly capable man. Even without marrying Yui — I believe you are indispensable to our group, destined to become one of its core members. My expectations for you remain unchanged."

At President Ichinose's words, Kitakami-san looked up, as if startled.

"Well then, that's good news, Shinji. So, that settles it. Both of you, that's good news."

　Yukiyasu turned to us and smiled, genuinely pleased.

After hearing President Ichinose's words, Kitakami bowed his head, said nothing, and turned his back on us.\
Then, with unsteady, faltering steps, he passed by Yukiyasu.

As he left the president's office with his head bowed, Yukiyasu waved at his retreating back with a bright smile.
