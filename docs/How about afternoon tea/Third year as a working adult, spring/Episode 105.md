Episode 105: Yui, Please, Don't Cry

I had a dream.

In a pitch-black cinema with no entrances or exits, I sat alone before a colossal screen.

Gazing at the pure white screen, devoid of any image, a figure gradually emerged.

Long black hair. Swaying in the spring breeze. She gazed at me and smiled, looking slightly younger than she does now, still the image of the schoolgirl I first fell in love with.

　Fragmented images, as if pieced together, were projected one after another, only to vanish.

So this is my memory, then—

The day I first met Yui-san at the airport. I found myself captivated by her beauty as she spotted me and smiled.

　Seated in the passenger seat of a sleek, shiny black luxury car, I gazed at her perfectly chiselled profile throughout the journey home.\
Her mesmerising dark eyes, her straight, refined nose, her soft, beautifully shaped lips, and the delicate line of her jaw were all terrifyingly captivating.

It was so striking, it remains seared into my mind even now. That's how profoundly impactful that encounter was.

　The nights you stayed up with me, when homesickness kept me awake.\
The gentle taste of sweet, honeyed hot milk.

When I felt lonely, you always held me gently.

Whenever I said I was hungry, you'd smile and make me a late-night snack.\
I loved watching your profile as you stood in the kitchen, a highball in hand.

　Our first kiss, tasting of grapefruit.

The night after we argued, that first ache in my chest, that heart-wrenching loneliness.

The huge orca at the aquarium. The sparkling spray reflecting the summer sunlight. The taste of seawater.

The fireworks we saw from the hotel on a summer night. The scent of your perfume as you held me close.

　The day I stopped you from leaving home, leaving me behind, and said "Don't go" for the first time.

Christmas when you gave me the necklace Yui-san had treasured.\
At the planetarium we watched side by side, we promised to go somewhere together someday where the stars would look beautiful.

That sweet yet aching night we first became one.

　Then — the look of utter despair on your face the moment I screamed, "I hate you!"

The strength of your arms holding me the day before we parted, and the feel of those cold tears — more eloquent than words in their sorrow — I remember them still, always.

Memories flashed by like a digest, projected onto a screen only to vanish. These were the fragments of memories I had carefully tucked away.

　Somehow it felt like a life review, I thought, caught between dream and reality.

It was the love of a lifetime, the kind that made me forget how to breathe.\
It was the kind of love that left me crying, screaming, covered in wounds.

Even so — meeting you was the greatest fortune of my life.

Then, abruptly, the images on the screen cut off.

　Wait. Please, don't end here. This story still has more to tell. We're still chasing what comes next, even now.

I wanted to see more of the continuation, but someone was calling me.

Just as the screen's light faded and I was about to sink into darkness, someone gripped my hand tightly, so tightly.

＊＊＊

An unfamiliar, stark white ceiling flooded my vision, and I instantly realised I wasn't at home.

A moment later, sharp pain shot through my head and then my entire body, making me groan involuntarily.

"Kanata...!"

Still unsure what had happened, I turned my gaze towards the voice.

"Yui-san...?"

Softly, she called my name. Her voice cracked, failing to form words.\
I noticed her left hand was warm, gripping mine tightly. How long had she been holding my hand like this? Her palm was damp with sweat.

Yui-san stood there, her eyes bloodshot.

　Though she must have left this morning wearing a suit without a single crease, the white blouse peeking from her rolled-up sleeves was rumpled, damp and translucent from repeated wiping of tears.

With each blink, large tears overflowed, streaming down her pale cheeks, tracing her slender jawline before plopping to the floor.

　Why was she crying? I wanted to wipe her tears and reached out to her cheek, but my arm felt astonishingly heavy, and my elbow ached terribly. Unable to bear it, I grimaced in pain. My hand flopped back onto the futon.

"Yui-san, the meeting... what happened?"

When I asked, Yui-san shook her head from side to side.

"That doesn't matter. I heard Kanata fell down the stairs... and was taken away in an ambulance, so..."

I clearly remembered talking to Kitakami-san on the emergency staircase.\
When he shook off my hand as I tried to stop him, I lost my balance — so that's it, I fell down the stairs.

Beyond that, my memories were only fragments here and there... vague.

　Looking out the window, the sun was already beginning to set, casting a crimson glow into the hospital room.

Could it be... she snuck out to come here...?\
She had an important meeting today, surely.

Yui-san kept wiping her tears with her sleeve, crying.

"Your eyes are bright red. Have you been crying this whole time...?"

"But... I was scared. The doctor said there was no need to worry, but still..."

"Yui, please, don't cry."

Yui knew better than anyone the grief of losing someone dear.\
And yet, how much anxiety had my careless injury caused her?

My chest ached as if being squeezed, and I felt like crying myself.

　I wanted to hold her, but it seemed I’d hit and scraped various places besides my head when I fell down the stairs, and my body wouldn’t move as I wished.

"I’m sorry for causing trouble on such an important day..."

"No. I’m just glad you’re safe, Kanata. I’m truly relieved... You were with Shinji, weren’t you? If he’d done anything to you, we’d have gone straight to the police..."

"No, it's not like that. Kitakami-san isn't to blame."

I wasn't covering for him; it was the truth. Kitakami-san had merely pushed my arm away; he hadn't shoved me down. I'd just lost my balance.

I remembered him reaching out to stop me as I fell. It absolutely wasn't deliberate. This was an accident that happened by chance.

"More importantly, are you really alright? You just walked out of the meeting midway..."

"I'm fine. I told Father I was going home because Kanata got hurt. I've contacted Yuki-nii too."

"I see..."

Oh dear, I've done it now. It was such a rare chance for a family dinner together, and I've ruined it.

Right, I must tell Yui-san what Kitakami-san said. Just as I tried to sit up, Yui-san hurriedly pressed my shoulder to stop me.

"Kanata. You mustn't sit up. You're being admitted to hospital today."

"Eh? Hospital? But it's just a minor injury..."

"It's not just a little. You'll be shocked when you look in the mirror later. Your whole body's covered in bruises. Lucky none of your bones were broken though..."

Hearing that, I touched my head where I'd been hit. I'd only thought I'd got a bump, but apparently the injury was worse than I'd realised.

"Is that so? I'm sorry to trouble you when you're so busy. But more importantly... Yui, about Kitakami-san..."

The moment I said that, a knock sounded and the hospital door swung open. Realising someone had entered, I turned my neck, which creaked as if it might snap, towards the door.

There stood a tall man, clad in an expensive-looking black pinstripe suit.\
The Ichinose Group company emblem gleamed on his lapel. His brows were sharply defined, his glossy black hair slicked back in an all-back style. His rugged features were almost Doberman-like.

"Father..."

"Eh..."

He quietly closed the door with a soft click and stared intently at me. His eyes were the same colour as Yui-san's.\
I recalled an old photograph Father had shown me long ago.

　This man — Yui-san's father.

Feeling it was hardly appropriate to remain lying down, I tried to sit up again, only to be stopped once more by Yui-san pressing down on my shoulders.

"Kanata, I told you not to sit up!"

"Bu-but... I'm sorry for staying down, President Ichinose..."

"Don't worry about that. More than anything, I'm truly sorry for injuring you during work. To injure your precious daughter... I can't even face Aosawa."

"...No, it was my carelessness."

His features were so well-defined that at first glance he'd seemed almost intimidating, like a hunting dog. But speaking with him, his manner was incredibly gentle.\
He really was Yui-san and Yukiyasu-san's father. Realising that, I felt a little relieved.

　President Ichinose glanced suddenly at Yui. Noticing her eyes, red from crying, he smiled wryly and ruffled her hair.

"What's that face for? It's rather unbecoming. Yui, if you look so helpless, Kanata-chan will only worry more. Pull yourself together."

"...Stop it, Dad."

　Yui-san pushed his hand away, clearly annoyed. Seeing this glimpse of the father-daughter dynamic in the Ichinose household, I couldn't help but smile.

"Um, President Ichinose. I'm terribly sorry for ruining today's meeting and the dinner gathering, which was such a special occasion..."

Please, I begged silently, staring into his eyes, hoping he wouldn't scold her.

　I know full well how crucial the presidents' meeting is. Moreover, this one was the culmination of a year's work. I understand perfectly well what it means for the president to skip it on the day itself.

"...True, as the president entrusted with the company, there are inevitably times when work must take precedence over private matters. But regarding this occasion, I have no intention of blaming Yui. Please rest assured. Everyone has things more important than work. That... I understand all too well."

My chest ached sharply. I recalled a story Yui had told me before. About when her mother passed away.

That day, Yui's father had an important meeting. So he couldn't return to his unwell family. As a result, on the way to the hospital, the car driven by Yui's mother was involved in an accident.

The fact that Yui's father couldn't return home wasn't the direct cause of the accident. Objectively speaking, I believe it was pure coincidence.\
Even so, it's human nature to feel regret over one's actions. How deeply must Yui's father have regretted prioritising his work?

That's why I thought – surely Yui's father wouldn't blame her.

"And actually... after the directors' meeting ended, Shinji came to see me. He told me everything about the two of you. To be honest, I'm bewildered. Part of me finds it hard to believe."

A sensation like the blood draining from my face washed over me.\
I'd been beaten to the punch. Realising this, I clenched my teeth in frustration.

　Kitakami-san clearly has no grasp of how deeply sinful it is to betray someone's sexual orientation.

Anger welled up inside me, staining my vision crimson.

Yui remained bowed, her face still lowered.

I didn't know how Kitakami-san had relayed our situation to President Ichinose.

But I wanted Yui to be the one to tell him.

　As if to reassure us in our silence, President Ichinose continued in a low, steady voice.

"...Of course, I have no intention of making a judgement based on just one side's account. Kanata-chan, once your injury has healed, we'll discuss this again then. Yui, is that alright with you too?"

"Father."

Yui-san squeezed my hand tightly. Then she lifted her face from its lowered position.

"...I'm serious."

At those words, President Ichinose said nothing, merely staring intently into Yui's eyes. I couldn't tell if that gaze was affirmative or negative.

"I understand. Yui, we'll talk about that another time. More importantly, let's let her rest now. And have you properly contacted Aosawa? He must be terribly worried. An employee was injured during work. As president, you must fulfil your responsibilities properly."

Yui-san, addressed in that calm, admonishing tone, nodded obediently.

"And... after hearing from Shinji-kun today, I also spoke with Yukiyasu. He bowed his head and asked me to listen to both of their sides before making a judgement."

Yui-san looked up, startled.\
　Yukiyasu-san, for our sake — he went that far. A warmth spread deep within her chest.

"...How many years had it been since I last spoke with Yukiyasu? I was delighted. Your father was also skilled at connecting people, but you two are truly alike. Kanata-chan, it's all thanks to you. Thank you."

"No, I didn't do anything..."

As she protested, President Ichinose gave a soft, gentle smile. I’d always thought Yui-san took after her mother, but that smile was remarkably like hers.

“Right then, I shouldn’t overstay my welcome. I’d best get back to the office. Yui, I’m counting on you for Kanata-chan.”

“…Yes, I understand.”

Yui-san held my hand tightly and gave a single, firm nod.
