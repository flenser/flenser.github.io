Episode 101: Kanata, What About the Welcome Home Kiss?

Rumours are a funny thing, as they say. Time has passed since that shocking Valentine's Day, and the gossip within the company about Yui-san's 'engagement' — which had been the talk of the office — was gradually dying down. It was April.

The bitter cold of winter, said to be one of the harshest in years, had somehow vanished without notice, and the street trees were now adorned with lush green leaves.

　After closing March's accounts, when we checked the profit and loss statement shared as a flash report from Accounting, Yui and I embraced in delight.

Though final adjustments were still pending and the exact figures weren't yet set in stone — it was clear we'd significantly exceeded the target Yui had promised her father.

And now, mid-April approached, bringing with it the quarterly "Group Joint Presidents' Meeting".

　This is a meeting where all the presidents of subsidiaries under Ichinose Holdings gather, serving as a final report to the parent company on the current term's business performance.

It remains unclear whether Yui-san will continue as president of this company for a fourth year.\
However, with April already here and the new fiscal year underway, there was no time to catch our breath. The tasks were piling up.

　Today is Friday.\
Yui has been swamped preparing materials for the presidents' meeting.

Since she didn't want to take work home and had told me to go ahead and wait for her, I clocked off at the regular time and headed towards her place.

I'd considered killing time at a café, but Yui had said she'd be back by nine, so I decided to take her at her word.

　I passed through the ticket gates at the station nearest Yui's house, one I'd walked past countless times during my student days. The surroundings were a little dim, but I thought the days had grown considerably longer compared to winter.

A pleasant spring evening breeze caressed my cheek. Cherry blossom petals, blown in from who knows where, fluttered and danced on the whirlwind.

Spring really is here, isn't it.

　I stopped by the supermarket we used to walk to together during our student days, located between the station and her house.

Blending in with the housewives doing their shopping, I wandered around the unfamiliar food aisles, smartphone in hand.\
Checking the ingredients needed for tonight's dinner, I carefully placed each item into my shopping basket.

　Minced beef and pork, onions, shimeji mushrooms, tinned tomatoes. The seasonings should be at Yui's place, so no need to buy those.

Since starting to live alone, I've tried to cook for myself when I have time – but honestly, I'm not confident I can make anything good enough to serve to someone else.

　Housework isn't my forte. That hasn't changed since my student days. But even if I'm unsure how well I'll manage, the only way forward is to try.\
I'll start with beginner-friendly recipes that are less likely to fail, and learn slowly.\
Even if it doesn't turn out delicious, Yui-san will surely praise my effort.

With these thoughts, I walked home carrying the shopping bag in one hand.

　I inserted the key Yui-san gave me at Christmas into the door's keyhole and turned it. With a satisfying click, the door swung open.\
Just this simple action made my heart feel warm and fuzzy, as if bathed in spring sunshine.

　Just before the clock's hour hand pointed to twenty-one, a clattering sound came from the entrance hall.\
Yui-san had come home. I hurriedly turned off the stove and, unable to stay put, trotted towards the entrance.

Opening the door connecting the living room and hallway, Yui-san saw me and smiled happily.\
Unable to contain myself, I ran over and threw my whole weight into hugging her.

"Welcome home, Yui."

"I'm back, Kanata. Sorry I kept you waiting."

Still clinging to her, I rubbed my cheek against her soft hair. I drew in the sweet scent of her perfume, filling my chest, and pressed my body tightly against hers.

　Back in my student days, I never liked waiting for Yui-san to come home.\
Just waiting endlessly for her return, never knowing where she'd wandered off to, made my chest ache with a stinging pain.

But now it's different. How utterly happy it makes me to wait for her return in this house, as her lover. The feelings welling up inside me are impossible to put into words.

　Yui smiled at me, reluctant to let go, and pressed her lips — still slightly cool from her return — gently against my cheek.

Then she pulled me firmly towards her waist, so I stopped those lips, now nearing my mouth, with the palm of my hand.\
Having already learnt that allowing a kiss here would mean a bath before dinner, I placed my hand on her shoulder, pushed Yui back, and swiftly created some distance.

"...Kanata, what about the welcome-home kiss?"

Ignoring Yui-san's discontented tone, I shook my head from side to side.

"I'm cooking right now. I need to get back to the kitchen immediately."

"Eh?"

"Today's stewed hamburger steak. Tomato flavour."

As I declared this with confidence, puffing out my chest, she seemed to notice I was wearing the yellow apron I'd bought recently, matching hers in colour. She looked at me, surprised.

"It'll be ready soon, you know."

Yui-san followed behind me as I headed back to the kitchen, the patter of her slippers echoing.

"Oh, really? It smells absolutely delicious... Kanata, did you make dinner?"

I stood before the frying pan once more and turned on the heat.

"Well, it doesn't look too great, I know... It's my first time, so please be kind."

The recipe site said stewed hamburgers were beginner-friendly, but to be honest, I wasn't entirely satisfied with the result.

　I measured the ingredients and seasonings properly, so the flavour should be fine, but shaping the hamburgers neatly proved too difficult for my clumsy hands.

Strange. The hamburgers Yui-san made for me before were so beautifully shaped, but mine are clearly misshapen.

But then, Yui-san is naturally dexterous, unlike me, so comparing myself to her is pointless. She's good at cooking, her handwriting's beautiful, and at night too — stopping myself before that thought finishes.

What am I thinking? Lately, I feel like I've been getting influenced by that lewd Yui-san.

Yui-san, who probably wouldn't dream I was thinking such things, hugged me tightly from behind and peered over my shoulder into the frying pan, where the contents continued to simmer away.

"Wow, that looks delicious. I'm getting really hungry."

"Cooking is difficult, isn't it? I couldn't manage washing dishes while cooking like you do, Yui-san."

My gaze drifted to the sink piled high with cooking utensils.

Even while cooking, Yui-san always efficiently washes the dishes and utensils she uses at the same time, so the sink stays clean even after cooking is finished.\
　But right now, the kitchen had been reduced to a pitiful state.

"Don't worry about that. I'll tidy up later, so let's eat together quickly."

Yui-san, seemingly not bothered at all, said this cheerfully as she planted a kiss on my cheek, and I breathed a sigh of relief.

Sitting opposite each other at the dining table, Yui-san happily clasped her hands together and said, "Let's eat."

I was so curious about Yui-san's reaction to the first bite of hamburger steak that I stared at her as if I could bore a hole through her.

"Um, how is it?"

"Mmm, it's absolutely delicious."

"Really?"

"Really. You should try some too, Kanata."

I couldn't rule out the possibility she was just being polite. What if it was awful? Thinking that, I took a bite of the hamburger steak I'd put on my own plate.

　The taste was... well, since I followed the recipe, it didn't seem too bad. If I could just overlook the slightly crumbly shape, I thought it was quite good for a first attempt.

Throughout the meal, Yui-san kept smiling happily. Seeing that made me feel warm inside too.\
Seeing her so pleased, I felt just a tiny bit of regret that I hadn't tried making it sooner.

＊＊＊

The room echoed with the sound of the dishwasher's water flow.

After my bath, I settled between Yui-san's legs as she sat on the sofa.\
Switching on the projector, I leaned my back against her and gently tugged her hands, encouraging her to hold me close. As I'd hoped, her arms wrapped softly around my body.

　Tonight, we had promised to watch a film together. A moment to soothe our work-weary hearts after a week; a private film viewing for just the two of us.\
I always have hot milk, while Yui-san drinks a highball. That too has remained unchanged since our student days.

"Hey, Kanata."

Less than ten minutes into the film, Yui suddenly called my name.

"What is it?"

"Next weekend, there's the directors' meeting, right? Actually... I was planning to tell him afterwards. ...My father. About breaking off the engagement."

Holding me tightly, Yui murmured this softly.

"And... I was thinking of consulting Yukiyo beforehand. He's helped me so much until now, and I think he's realised I like you... I was wondering if it would be alright to properly tell him in words again."

Without thinking, I spun around completely. Startled by my sudden movement, Yui-san's eyes widened slightly.

"Yui-san, didn't you know that Yukiyo-san realised about us!? I just assumed..."

I stopped mid-sentence and hastily covered my mouth. Oh dear, that was a slip of the tongue.\
I thought it, but it was too late. Yui-san narrowed her eyes slightly and grabbed my arm firmly, preventing me from escaping.

"...Kanata, how did you know Yuki-nii noticed us?"

"Er, well, that's..."

"...You're not... keeping in touch, are you? Could it be when you delivered the minutes?"

I averted my gaze. I couldn't say it. That I'd known his contact details for much longer...

"Well... you know, with everything that happened with Kitakami-san, I needed to talk things through. But that's all! We don't keep in touch normally."

When I said that much, Yui frowned, looking thoroughly displeased.\
Oh dear, I'd done it. Yui absolutely hated me having anything to do with Yukiyasu-san.\
I knew it stemmed from jealousy, but still.

"Kanata—"

"...I'm sorry for keeping quiet..."

When I apologised honestly, Yui sighed deeply, deeply, then pulled me tightly into a hug from the front.

"I know it's impossible to avoid him entirely... but please, I beg you, don't ever fall for Yuki-nii."

"That's impossible, isn't it? He's your brother, after all?"

"But I'm genuinely worried, you see. Yuki-nii is like me, isn't he? Unlike me, Kanata was straight to begin with... I just worry she might prefer men."

She nuzzled her cheek against my neck, pouting as she spoke. What? She'd been fretting over that? I couldn't help but laugh.

　Still pouting, lips turned down, I gently stroked her cheek as if cherishing it, peering into her dark eyes.

"Yui-san, you've got it all wrong. I like you just as you are, Yui-san. I like you completely, including your gender."

Her eyes, sulking unhappily, softened with relief at my words.

　I kissed her, my apology embedded in the gesture, and Yui seemed to forgive me. She gently stroked my back and pulled me close.

"...When you consult Yukiyasu-san, may I be present too?"

"Yes, of course. Let's go together. When it comes to Shinji, Yukiyasu-san knows far more than I do, and we need to be prepared in case things get messy. The more allies we have, the better."

She nodded.\
Kitakami-san is a man with the tenacity of a snake. We don't know him very well, but Yukiyasu-san does.

The day when we will be free is steadily drawing nearer. To achieve that, we must take every possible measure.
