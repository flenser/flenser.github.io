Episode 103: That sort of thing feels like a proposal, doesn't it?

And so Thursday arrived.\
Tomorrow was the day of the 'Presidents' Meeting' — after which Yui-san had a dinner meeting scheduled with Yukiyasu-san and her father.

I quietly observed Yui-san sitting at her desk.\
The materials for the Presidents' Meeting had been completed yesterday, and the data had already been shared with the parent company. She had no appointments scheduled for today. Therefore, it should be a relatively relaxed day.

　Yet Yui-san seemed restless, occasionally sighing or twirling her pen deftly with a gloomy expression.

Well, that makes sense. Even someone like Yui-san couldn't help but feel nervous.

We'd already demonstrated through results that we could manage without Kitakami-san.\
But that was merely one piece of evidence to help convey Yui-san's wish to break off the engagement and gain understanding.\
　I understand all too well the weight of telling one's father the fundamental fact of being homosexual, having come out to my own family just the other day.

I cannot be present at this family-only dinner.\
But it's unbearably frustrating. That I cannot be there to hold your hand, the hand that must be trembling with nerves.

"...Yui-san."

"...Hmm? What is it, Kanata?"

　Yui looked up from her monitor and gazed at me gently.

"It's just the right time. How about some afternoon tea?"

When I suggested this, Yui smiled softly and nodded.

I opened the cupboard in the kitchenette – now thoroughly transformed into my personal teapot storage – and took out the teapot. As I opened the small tin holding the tea leaves, I heard footsteps and turned around.

"Oh, it's Aosawa-san. Good work today."

"Ah, Seno-san, good work today."

Seno-san, who seemed to have returned from lunch, was carrying a cute floral-patterned lunch tote. She placed her empty lunchbox on the sink and picked up a sponge with practised ease.

"You had a late lunch today, didn't you?"

"Yeah, been busy lately. Aosawa-san, having tea with the president?"

"Yes. Thought we'd take a little break."

He put the tea leaves and hot water into the teapot and set the timer.\
Seno-san, humming thoughtfully as she washed the lunchbox with the lathered sponge, said in a calm voice.

"...I'm relieved to see you're alright, Aosawa-san. I was a bit worried, you know."

"Eh?"

Tilting my head, unsure what she meant, Seno-san curved her full lips into a thin smile and whispered in a voice so soft it seemed meant for no one else.

"Because, Aosawa-san's girlfriend is... the president, right?"

My eyes widened in shock. My heart leapt as if seized, and I stared intently into her eyes.\
As I froze, unable to say either YES or NO, Seno-san continued, "Don't worry."

"I haven't told anyone, and I don't intend to. Kaori hasn't noticed at all either. I just thought it must have been tough for her. Things have calmed down recently, but all sorts of rumours were flying around. Still, Aosawa-san is a strong girl, isn't she?"

The rinsed-off foam flowed down the drain. Realising she was speaking without any malice, I gradually regained my composure.

"Seno-san... how did you notice?"

"Well, you see, that necklace the president had been wearing since she arrived? Aosawa-san suddenly started wearing it too... And that necklace with the same motif as those earrings? The president wears that one as well."

Ah... So, people who notice, do notice. I slumped, shoulders dropping. As I did, the timer rang, and I hurriedly poured tea into the cup.

"The president didn't seem to like that person at all, did she? ...Well, I suppose being with someone you like is best after all."

Seno-san let that slip out quietly. I looked at her in surprise. I never imagined Seno-san would say something like that.\
　She gave an awkward smile, tucked the washed lunchbox into her tote bag, and waved at me as she fluttered away.\
I could only stare blankly after her retreating figure.

I didn't know what had changed in her heart – she was the one who'd said she wanted to marry a rich man. But... people do change, don't they?

With those thoughts, I carried the tray back to the president's office.

＊＊＊

We sat side by side on the black leather sofa, our shoulders pressed together. The refreshing aroma of the afternoon blend, a Ceylon tea, soothed my heart.

"Your tea really is the best, Kanata."

"Of course it is. There's a secret ingredient."

"A secret ingredient?"

"Plenty of love. Just for you, Yui-san."

Saying this with pride, Yui-san smiled and wrapped her arm around my waist, pulling me closer. Rubbing her cheek against my neck, she was far more clingy than usual, utterly adorable.

"I'm so glad you became my secretary. Being able to touch like this even during work is the best."

"You say that a lot. You were so reluctant at first."

"Sorry, sorry. I didn't want you to force yourself. Back then."

"For someone you care about, strangely enough, you can do anything. It doesn't feel like a burden at all."

"I understand that. I feel the same way."

I met her gaze as she stared intently at me. Somehow, her eyes seemed more unsettled than usual, and I couldn't help but be troubled by it.

"...Yui, are you alright?"

"Eh?"

"You've been fidgeting since this morning. Is there anything I can do...?"

I gently took her hand and stroked the smooth back of her palm. I wanted so badly to ease that unease, even just a little. But how? I was tormented by my own helplessness.\
Yui-san kept her eyes lowered to our joined hands and murmured softly.

"Hey, Kanata. ...Would it be a bother if I asked you to stay over tonight?"

Her voice, so meek, so vulnerable, tinged with a hint of sweetness, made my heart tremble violently.

"...I want you to be with me tonight. Is that too much to ask?"

Seeing her, usually so confident, looking so fragile, felt like my heart was being crushed. It made me want to think seriously about how I could possibly heal that heart.

"...Of course it's not too much. I'll stay with you. All night long."

I held Yui-san close as she nestled against my shoulder. To soothe her tense body, rising and falling with shallow breaths, I kept stroking her back with my palm.

Even after returning home, Yui-san seemed distant, speaking less than usual. As if dreading even the slightest separation, she clung to me, refusing to let go.

Sitting on the sofa, we pressed our bodies together as close as possible.\
She pressed her lips against my cheek, my neck, again and again, clinging to me tightly. Yet in those arms, there was none of the passionate desire I usually felt. Only a direct, unadulterated touch that conveyed she simply didn't want to let me go.

"...I might not be able to sleep tonight."

Confiding a secret takes courage. It's only natural to feel afraid. Having been through it myself, I understand Yui-san's feelings all too well right now.\
I'm sure all sorts of thoughts are racing through her mind at this moment.\
Is there any way to help? Something to take her mind off it.

"...In that case, why not skip trying to force yourself to sleep? How about staying up late with me tonight?"

"Staying up late?"

"Don't you remember, Yui? Right after I first came to this house?"

When I was spending sleepless nights, homesick and filled with loneliness and anxiety, Yui made me sweet hot milk with honey in it — and invited me to stay up late together, saying, "If you can't sleep, let's stay up together."

How much that kindness dispelled my unease. It's still an unforgettable, precious memory.

"You often stayed up late with me, didn't you?"

Then, as if remembering, Yui-san smiled.

"Come to think of it, we did that. How nostalgic."

"If you can't sleep, I'll stay up with you too. What shall we do tonight?"

I clasped Yui-san's hands tightly with both of mine. Yui-san, who had looked so preoccupied just moments ago, suddenly smiled, then said as if she'd thought of something.

"Well then... fancy joining me for a drive to take our minds off things?"

I'd been the one to suggest staying up late, but I was genuinely surprised she'd suggest going to see the Rainbow Bridge.

Yui's beloved car glided smoothly along the Metropolitan Expressway, weaving through the night city.

"Before I met you again, I used to drive alone a lot. Being home alone sometimes got me down. Driving means I don't have to think about anything, and it just feels refreshing."

The Rainbow Bridge came into view. We sped past the glittering, illuminated bridge like the wind.\
Seeing how familiar she was with it, I wondered if this might be Yui-san's regular driving route.

I want to remember this night. From tomorrow, our relationship would change. I couldn't begin to describe how much I'd longed for this day to come.

Perhaps there had been crushingly difficult nights leading up to this moment. How many times had Yui-san driven along this road during those times?

I mustn't forget. The days of blood, sweat and tears you've poured into building this for me, the foundation upon which our happiness now stands — I absolutely will not forget.

　After crossing the Rainbow Bridge, Yui-san parked the car in a lot right near the seaside park.

"Since we're here, let's explore a bit."

Stepping out, I caught the scent of the sea in the still-chilly spring night breeze.\
Hand in hand, we walked along the coast towards the sandy shore. In the distance, the Rainbow Bridge we'd just crossed was visible. The city lights reflected on the water, sparkling and shimmering.

"It is a bit chilly, isn't it?"

"Well, it is the sea."

"Kanata, are you cold? Shall we go back?"

"No. I'd like to stay here a little longer."

At that, Yui-san embraced me from behind, as if to warm me. I gently squeezed her arms.

"...Hey, Yui. What do you want to do from now on?"

What future did Yui envision? Right now, I wanted to talk about the future. Not just tomorrow, but a brighter future further ahead.

"From now on? Hmm... I'd like to travel. I want us to go to lots of places together. Is there somewhere you'd like to go, Kanata?"

"Of course I do. I want to visit every single place in Japan."

"Everywhere? Well then, why not buy a camper van and go on a trip to conquer every aquarium in Japan?"

"That sounds brilliant. Let's buy a map of Japan and colour in each place as we go."

"What will we do after conquering all forty-seven prefectures?"

"Then next, let's go travelling overseas. If it's an English-speaking country, leave it to me."

"You're so dependable. Thinking about it like this... the future is full of nothing but things to look forward to. Being with you, Kanata, makes me feel like anything could come true."

We had finally reached the point where we could talk about the future like this.\
From that spring day when I first met Yui-san at the airport — six years were about to pass.

"...Hey, Yui-san."

"Hmm?"

"...I never knew happiness could feel like this."

"It's true. It still feels like a dream. When we first met, I never imagined Kanata would ever like me."

"I never imagined I'd meet someone I could like this much either. It's because it's you, Yui-san, that I feel this way."

"It's the same for me. It's because it's you, Kanata, that I feel this way. I'm so glad I didn't give up."

I turned to look into her eyes.

"Yui-san. From now on, please rely on me more. No matter what happens, I'll always be by your side."

I clasped her left hand tightly in both of mine. Please let my feelings reach you straight and true.

"I want to live with you, Yui-san, for the rest of my life."

　I gazed into her deep, dark eyes, like a calm night sea. Then Yui smiled happily.

"...Kanata, that kinda sounds like a proposal, doesn't it? My heart just skipped a beat."

"Eh?"

I hadn't meant it that way, but hearing her say that suddenly made me feel embarrassed. Seeing my reaction, Yui laughed, took my left hand, and kissed my ring finger.

"I-I didn't mean it like that..."

"Thank you, Kanata. I feel the same way. But I'd like to be the one to propose. Wait for me, and expect it."

Saying that, Yui peered into my eyes and smiled defiantly. Flustered, I pushed her shoulder away as she drew near.

"Now, that's not it. That just now wasn't a proposal, I tell you!"

As if to brush it off, Yui laughed out loud, ahaha. In her eyes, there wasn't a shred of anxiety left.

With the sound of the waves as our background music, we pressed our chilled lips together in a kiss that was nothing more than a touch.

Then we looked at each other and laughed, clasping each other's hands tightly, firmly, and strongly.
