Episode 88: Why on earth are you so lecherous, Yui-san?

After weathering a hectic week, Saturday mornings spent nestled close together always find me waking before Yui-san.

Feeling the faint sunlight seeping through the curtains, I slowly pushed my eyelids open.

December seems to pass far quicker than any other month of the year.\
　A week passes like the wind, and just when I think the precious weekend we can spend together has arrived, Monday comes and another week of living apart begins.

She, who dislikes mornings, is always still in my dreams even after I wake.

I gaze at her, breathing softly beside me.

I gently brush the silky black hair from her cheek and stroke her smooth, flawless white skin.

　I adored this time before she wakes.\
Just gazing at her perfectly composed sleeping face made time melt away in an instant.\
I longed to see the colour of her eyes behind those tightly closed lids — yet even your breath in deep slumber filled me with such heart-wrenching tenderness.

Yui, I wonder what dreams you're having. I hope they're happy ones.

* * *

　The promised Monday with Kitakami-san draws near.

I intended to tell Yui-san about this after meeting him once more to settle things.

It's not that I'm not afraid of Kitakami-san.

Having rejected what was likely his greatest concession, I don't know what actions he might take against me, who effectively declared war.

But I too have things I cannot yield.

　The girl before me is one of them. This love — no matter how mud-splattered and scarred it becomes — is something I cannot abandon over this.\
Even if the day comes when people point fingers behind my back, I will live with her. That is what I have decided.

Kitakami-san surely doesn't love Yui-san, so what kind of feeling is it to want to be with her? And... doesn't that feel hollow?

Perhaps he has never truly loved anyone?

　Is status and honour really that important? What is it he truly wants?

Even if you had money to burn, could that alone truly make someone happy?

I haven't the foggiest what it is Kitakami-san is so desperate for.

If all you want is something like that, then I absolutely cannot give Yui-san to you.\
She isn't someone to be consumed merely to satisfy such shallow desires.

He surely doesn't know how incredibly delicate and loving she is.

　I gently trace the outline of her perfectly shaped lips with my thumb.

I realise now that it simply has to be Yui. My heart and body can no longer be satisfied by anyone but you.\
I've been spoiled by kindness and affection, and that's what it's done to me.

She's kind yet cruel, making me want to run away yet crave more. Each time she touches me, it feels like an unknown part of myself is being dragged out, and it terrifies me.

　Being with Yui-san means discovering things for the very first time.

I recall that piercing, feverish gaze looking down at me in the darkness.\
The sensation of slightly sweaty, warm skin touching mine, that indescribably sweet pleasure when those long fingers reached deep inside me... Yui-san taught me all of it.

I understand perfectly why so many women became captivated by her.\
　Jealousy over the past is pointless, but if only we'd met sooner — could I have kept your heat untouched by anyone else?

I'll never tell her how utterly captivated I am by her. It's too humiliating.

When I pressed my lips to her forehead, her long lashes trembled. I hadn't meant to wake her, but behind her eyelids, those yearning black eyes reflected me.

"Mm... Good morning, Kanata..."

I adore that soft, sleepy voice too. Seeing Yui like this in the morning is a privilege reserved solely for me right now.

"...Good morning, Yui-san."

Her hand reached out, trying to pull me closer. So I didn't hesitate, nestling into her chest.

"A big bed really is nice, isn't it? No need to worry about falling out."

　My apartment bed is single-sized, so it's a bit cramped for two people. Even when Yui-san came over last time, I was constantly worried she might fall out if she rolled over.

I'm glad Yui-san's bed is double. Honestly, this size is just right for sleeping together.

"Hmm, really? I quite like sleeping together in Kanata's bed though."

"But isn't a single bed a bit too narrow, honestly?"

"I know, but... I really like how special Kanata's bed feels when she's asleep too..."

I understood that feeling. After all, I too preferred sleeping in Yui-san's bed over my own — I slept far more soundly there.

Dozing in her arms, perhaps because I felt so secure, I found myself drifting off again.\
But I couldn't afford to fall back asleep now. I had plans to go out with Yuri today, so I had to get up.

"...Hey, Yui-san, I'm too cold to get out from under the duvet. Where are my pyjamas?"

"Ah, sorry, I might have just flung them somewhere."

The cosy, fluffy pyjamas she'd bought me, with their lovely feel, had been swiftly removed by her hand last night, along with my underwear.

　They've probably fallen under the bed, but Yui-san got too hot and turned off the heating, then flung the aircon remote somewhere, so getting out of this bed to turn the heating back on is just too painful.

"...Since you took it off, you take responsibility for finding it. I don't want to get out of bed because it's cold."

"Eh? You're getting dressed already? Your appointment with Yuri-chan is at noon, right? Let's sleep together a little longer."

"...But I'll be cold if I don't get dressed."

When I said this sulkily, Yui-san laughed.

"Cold? I see. Well then, I'll warm you up."

"Eh? Wh-wait a sec, Yui-san?"

Yui-san slowly leaned over me, grinning as she brought her lips close to my neck.\
Her mischievous left hand traced my unguarded thigh beneath the duvet, so I instinctively pushed her shoulder away with my palm – the spot still slightly red and swollen from a bite mark.

"Kanata, that hurts. No touching the wound."

Yui-san said, looking sullenly displeased. True, I felt bad about touching the wound.\
But being pressed like this in this situation was a bit problematic.\
After all, I wasn't wearing any clothes, so I had no way to defend myself right now.

"But it's because Yui-san was trying to do something weird..."

"You said you were cold, so I thought I'd warm you up."

I did say I was cold, but I never asked to be warmed. I only asked her to "find me some clothes".

"Is that not allowed?"

As her hand, caressing my skin, slowly crept upwards, I stopped it by clamping it between my inner thighs. Yui gave a faint smile.

"...Why are you so lecherous, Yui? Lately, you've been like a wolf..."

It's not like Yui's lechery started just now, but wanting it first thing in the morning? That was unexpected. Living together like this... what on earth will become of us?\
Being desired this intensely leaves me at a loss. ...Though I suppose it's just me being me to think I don't dislike it.

"With Kanata lying naked beside me, it'd be impossible not to feel something. Please, I beg you. I'll promise to stop after just once."

"But you've never actually stopped after just once..."

"I promise. Please."

Her lips brushed my earlobe, sending a shiver down my spine. Pleased by my reaction, Yui-san pulled me close with her right arm.

"...Yui-san, you've always loved having sex with girls, haven't you?"

Pouting my lips in feeble resistance, I said this, and Yui-san laughed.

"I won't deny that... but it's not just any girl I want it with. I want it with you, Kanata."

"Really... just once? Will you promise me...?"

"Yes, of course. I promise."

Her soft tongue traced my neck, gently biting my collarbone. The red mark left yesterday should still be there. My breath caught as her lips touched me, full of tenderness.

　Just a few brushes of her lips ignited heat deep within my stomach, draining the strength from my body.\
Taking advantage of that, the hand tracing up my thigh reached between my legs.\
A small gasp escaped me, and my hips trembled.

Before I could prepare myself mentally, the sensation of her fingers touching that sensitive spot made me shudder. Yui looked down at me and smiled teasingly.

"Fufu, that's quite something..."

"...Don't say things like that..."

I bit my lip tightly in protest. The smoothness of her fingertip's touch made me realise what state I was in, and I felt mortified.

Even as she apologised, "Sorry, sorry," Yui slid her body relentlessly between my legs. I was utterly helpless, so I clasped her back tightly.\
　Cold air seeped in through the gap in the lifted futon.

"Yui-san, I'm cold..."

"...You'll warm up soon, it'll be fine."

Just hearing my name whispered softly in my ear made me feel dizzy. The sensation of her fingertips touching me was melting my rationality into a gooey mess.

Completely forgetting it was morning, I pressed my lips to the nape of her neck and gently bit down, as if clinging to her.

＊＊＊

I knew this would happen, so why did I agree to Yui-san's request?

I whipped my still-sluggish body into shape and managed to finish getting ready just before our planned departure time, but I was still a little sulky.

"Kanata, your outfit today is lovely. I'm rather envious — I wish I could have gone on a date with you instead."

I shot Yui a glare as she sat on the sofa, sipping her milk tea with such nonchalance.

It was entirely her fault I'd been forced to wear the freshly laundered white high-neck top meant for tomorrow's date — the one that could cover her kiss marks, left on my neck as if to say, "Here, take that."

　And it wasn't just my neck. Her mark was everywhere – my stomach, my thighs, all over. She really has no restraint lately.

Not that I'm one to talk, mind.\
A fresh bite mark had appeared on the nape of my neck, visible beneath her white sweatshirt. It was brand new, made when I bit her this morning.

　Even when I bite her, Yui doesn't get angry. She groans in pain for a moment when my teeth sink in, but that's all.

Once, when I pointed out a bite mark she'd got from another girl, she said, "That hurt so much, I don't think there'll be a next time." I'd worried about that a little, but so far, there's been plenty of "next times", so I suppose she must forgive me.

　I simply can't resist it. I know it's a bad habit, but I can't stop.

Usually, I apologise every single time for this bad habit, but this time, I had absolutely no intention of apologising.

True, Yui-san did keep the promise of "just once". But that promise led to me having a terrible time.\
Because — I never imagined that "once" would involve being teased like that.

　No matter how many times I begged her to stop, saying I couldn't take it anymore, Yui-san stubbornly refused to let go, whining that she didn't want to stop yet. By the middle, I was practically in tears.

"...But I'm going on a date with Yui-san tomorrow, aren't I? Today is the day I go on a date with Yuri."

I abruptly looked away and said this curtly. Yui-san's eyes widened in surprise as she peered intently at my face.

"Eh? Kanata, are you still sulking?"

"Not really... I'm not sulking."

"I'm sorry, I said. Cheer up. I kept my promise, didn't I?"

"...I'm going to be late, so I'll be off now."

Just once, I'll never say that again. Swearing that to myself, I grabbed my bag and headed for the front door. Then, from behind, I was pulled back with a tight hug, stopping me in my tracks.

"Kanata. I'll walk you to the meeting spot."

"It's fine. I've already checked the train times."

"Well then, I'll come pick you up on the way back."

"...I won't be late today, so I can take the train home."

"Oh? Well then, I'll make dinner and wait for you."

"Eh... Is that alright?"

　Yui-san really is good at keeping me happy, as always. Even though I should be sulking, I wonder about myself for being so easily lured by food...

"Of course. Shall we have stew for dinner? You said you fancied it yesterday, didn't you?"

Even my casual remarks while staring blankly at the telly, Yui-san picks up on them effortlessly.\
That makes me happy. It makes me feel she truly loves me.

　I nodded, and Yui's lips touched my cheek.

"Take care. Off you go."

Hearing her say that in that gentle tone made me feel silly for sulking.\
Somehow, I felt like I'd been neatly wrapped around her little finger... but never mind.

"...Right then, I'm off."

I waved reluctantly, and Yui smiled and waved back at me.

＊＊＊

The reason I'd asked Yuri to come along today was because I wanted her help choosing a Christmas present for Yui-san.

I doubt there's anyone else besides Yuri who'd put up with me dragging her around all day without complaining, given how indecisive I am.

　After agonising over it, I settled on a pair of leather gloves with a cute little logo as the present.\
The news said this winter was going to be particularly cold, so I chose black ones she could use on business trips too, hoping they'd keep her a bit warmer.\
When I tried them on, the fingertips were a bit loose on my hands... but I'm sure they'll fit her long fingers perfectly.

I'll add a hand cream from the same brand as Yui-san's favourite perfume to the present.

I recall her perfectly manicured fingertips, not a single hangnail in sight. As the season approaches when we wash our hands more often to avoid catching colds, I reckon one can never have too many tubes of hand cream.

Yuri would occasionally tease me as I agonised over choosing the perfect gift, yet she always smiled, looking rather pleased.

　After treating her to our company hotel's renowned afternoon tea as a thank-you for accompanying me, Yuri and I parted ways before dinner.

On the train home, I messaged Yui-san: "Heading back now."

Unusually, she replied almost immediately. "It's ready!" came the message, accompanied by a photo of a pot filled with creamy stew. I couldn't help but smile.

　Exhaling white breath, I walked briskly towards Yui-san's house, my thoughts drifting to the stew.

Little by little, the gloomy Monday drew nearer.

But once I got through that, the Christmas I'd waited four years for was just around the corner.
