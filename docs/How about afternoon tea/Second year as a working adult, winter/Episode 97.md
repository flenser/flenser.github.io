Episode 97: I haven't actually been proposed to yet

Before long, I told Mum and Kaname, who had just returned from shopping, that I was seeing someone and wanted to be with her.

Mum, who was naturally easygoing, was surprised but didn't seem particularly flustered. She just cheerfully remarked, "So you've found someone good too, Kanata."

Kaname, on the other hand, was furious, just as I'd expected.

　"What sort of girl is she? Can she really make my sister happy? Bring her here this instant! I won't accept it until I've spoken to her!" he ranted and raved, while Mum and Dad desperately tried to calm him down.

It's not like we're getting married or anything... But seeing how Yō had lived in this country where same-sex marriage is legal far longer than I had, he didn't seem to have much of a hang-up about gender, which was a bit of a relief.

　I never imagined Kaname was such a devoted big sister's boy, but somehow, it made me happy to realise he loved me after all.

Still, I'm sure Kaname will understand once he meets Yui-san. And it sounds amusing, so I'll leave him angry for now. When they meet, I might get to see Yui-san getting bitten and beaten into submission by Kaname.

Perhaps the tension has eased, but I'm starting to feel a bit sleepy. Seems my jet lag hasn't fully cleared yet.

"Dad, Mum, I'm still sleepy. I'm going to take a nap."

"Ah, sis, we still need to talk..."

"Goodnight."

Cutting Yō off, I headed to my room, yawning.\
I plopped down on the bed and hugged my companion, Shachi-kun, who'd come with me from Japan.

　It was night in Japan, so I decided to call Yui-san. Better to tell her soon. She must be worried about my family's reaction.\
I slid my finger across my smartphone. After a few rings, Yui-san answered.

'Hello? Kanata?'

Through my left ear pressed against the phone, I heard her soft, sweet, happy voice.

"Yui-san, were you still up?"

It was late afternoon here, but in Japan it must be just past eleven at night. I was glad she wasn't asleep.

Still hugging Shachi-kun, I flopped down onto the bed. Closing my eyes, I focused on that beloved voice. I wanted to hear Yui-san's voice more clearly.

‘I was awake. How are you feeling, Kanata?’

‘Still a bit sleepy, but much better.’

Just a few days apart, yet hearing her voice alone ignited a burning longing.\
It made me realise how utterly central Yui-san had become to my life, leaving me with a tingling unease.\
Before dating Yui-san, I’d never imagined I could possess such a lover-centric way of thinking.

"...Yui, listen. I just... I told my family."

The moment I said it, I could hear her gasp on the other end.

When I told my father I was "dating a woman", I finally understood why Yui had seemed so worried all this time.

　Coming out to my family took an enormous amount of courage.\
I should have believed I’d be alright, yet my limbs still trembled, my throat went dry, and my heart pounded so fiercely I felt it might burst through my chest.

It was precisely because I knew that feeling that I realised something.

Perhaps Yui-san had once tried to tell her father too. That must be why she looked so worried.\
I'm sure she's experienced this bottomless tension, this indescribable anxiety.

"...How did it go?"

Seeing Yui-san looking uneasy, I chuckled softly.

"It was nothing. Both my father and mother accepted me."

I decided to keep quiet about my brother screaming, "Bring her here right now!" for now.

"Yui-san's father will definitely understand too. After all, he's Yui-san's father."

I could tell Yui-san let out a deep sigh of relief.

‘I see… That’s good. Kanata… Thank you, truly.’

Knowing she meant it from the heart, a warmth slowly spread deep within my chest.\
The fact that our parents had accepted us calmed our hearts more than I’d imagined.

‘I want to see Yui-san… soon.’

‘…Yes. I want to see Kanata soon too.’

　There were still things we needed to do to ensure we could stay together forever.\
But today, I think it was okay to be happy that we'd managed to overcome that first small hurdle.

Next time, I'll definitely come here with Yui-san. When all the problems have been cleared up.

The day I can introduce you to my father and mother, and my slightly grumpy younger brother, I can hardly wait.

　＊＊＊

My homecoming after two years passed far quicker than I'd imagined.\
Before I knew it, the New Year arrived, and suddenly it was time to return.\
I'd bought far too many souvenirs, making my luggage bulky and a real pain to pack.

After cramming the suitcase into the back seat, Kaname climbed into the driver's seat. I followed him into the passenger seat.

"Sorry, Kaname. Thanks for seeing me off."

I said this while fastening my seatbelt. Though looking a bit put out, Kaname gave a small nod. I rolled down the passenger window and waved to my parents as the car began its journey to the airport.

Gazing out at the passing streetscape, I was dozing off as the car rocked along when Kaname suddenly spoke up in a heavy tone.

"Listen, sis..."

"Hmm?"

"Don't you think... it's still a bit early to decide on marriage?"

"Eh?"

Caught completely off guard by this sudden, unrelated remark, I stared at his profile as he gripped the steering wheel, eyes fixed straight ahead. His brow was furrowed, his expression clearly displeased.

　Ever since my confession, Kaname had been sulking, so I knew he must have been thinking about something. But I hadn't expected him to bring this up right now, on the way to the airport. I was a little taken aback.

"Of course, I want to celebrate for you, okay? But still... I really need to meet her... I can't tell if she'll truly treat you well or not..."

By the time Kaname finished saying that, I found myself laughing out loud. I hadn't realised he'd been thinking about it so seriously.\
I'd assumed he was just sulking. Yo had grown up far more than I'd realised.

"Wh-why are you laughing? I'm trying to be quite serious here."

"Yō, in Japan, same-sex marriage isn't legal."

"Eh, it isn't!?"

"That's right. And besides, she hasn't even proposed yet."

Saying that, I held up my left hand, ringless, for him to see. Then Kaname sighed, sounding deflated, "What the hell..." and pressed his back against the seat.

For now, though. For now.\
As long as there are unresolved issues, I still can't slip a ring onto this ring finger.

　But — once all the problems are resolved, I suppose I can start hoping then. Because this summer, Yui-san promised me, "Next time, I'll buy you a ring."

"...But next time, I'll definitely bring her along. I'll make sure you meet her properly. She's absolutely gorgeous, so I reckon you'll be jealous."

"I won't be jealous. Because my girlfriend is definitely cuter, you know."

　I laughed at Yō sticking out his tongue. Despite everything, it seemed he’d stayed with the girlfriend he’d had since high school. That’s probably why he hadn’t chosen a Japanese university, I vaguely imagined.

The car sped relentlessly towards the airport.

Leaving my family behind was lonely, but I’d see Yui-san soon. Thinking that, the fluttering in my chest only accelerated.

＊＊＊

After enduring the interminably long flight that never seemed to end, I finally arrived at Haneda Airport.\
Collecting my suitcase, I hurried towards the exit.\
True to her word, Yui-san was waiting for me right by the arrivals gate. The moment our eyes met, her face lit up with a bright smile.

　I dashed straight towards her and threw myself into her open arms. The moment our bodies pressed tightly together, it felt like my nearly depleted emotional fuel tank was instantly filled to the brim.

"I'm home, Yui-san."

"Welcome back, Kanata. I was so lonely. I missed you terribly."

Her clear voice, different from over the phone, resonated in my eardrums and shook my very heart.\
After filling my lungs with the scent of my beloved Yui, I held her body as tightly as I could.

　After loading the suitcase, now denser and heavier than when I left, and the paper bag of souvenirs into the boot, I settled into the passenger seat of her beloved car, one I knew well.\
She fastened her seatbelt, pressed the button beneath the steering wheel, and the engine roared to life. Pressing the accelerator, the car began to move. Our destination was my flat.

"By the way, did you find a nice perfume for Ritsu as a souvenir?"

"Well, I really couldn't decide myself, so I just let the shop assistant choose it for me. I suppose I ought to pop round to give Ritsu her souvenir too."

"Ah, Ritsu's visiting her family too. She shouldn't be back yet."

So Ritsu was visiting her family as well. I think I heard her family home was in Akita when we went to the New Year shrine visit together before.

"...Speaking of which, Yui, have you been to the New Year shrine visit yet?"

"No, not yet. Somehow, I just can't bring myself to go alone."

"I see... Well then, since we're here, shall we go now?"

"Eh, now? Kanata, aren't you sleepy?"

Yui-san, seemingly concerned about my jet lag, glanced at me while driving.

"I'm fine, I'm not sleepy at all right now. I need to pay my respects, draw a fortune slip, and make a wish for business prosperity."

　Seeing Yui-san had me so wound up I wasn't sleepy now. But I knew if I went home and crawled into bed, I'd never get up again.\
So if we were going, now was our only chance.

"Right then, understood. Let's go now, then."

Yui-san smiled at my suggestion. Then she turned the wheel away from home.

＊＊＊

Perhaps because the first three days of the year had passed, there were fewer worshippers than I'd expected. As I rubbed my hands together, numb from the cold, Yui-san offered me one of her gloves.\
The glove I'd given her – Santa Claus, that is – fit her long fingers perfectly, just as I'd thought it would.\
Taking it and slipping it onto my left hand, she clasped my right hand tightly. Then that hand was drawn into Yui-san's pocket.

　I tossed every last coin I had into the offering box, making the bells clatter. Then I clapped my hands firmly.\
I glanced sideways at Yui, who stood beside me, hands pressed together, eyes closed.\
What on earth was she wishing for with that earnest profile? Though I knew better than to ask such a tactless question.

I closed my eyes once more.

　Back in our school days, Yui had said, "God has never once granted a single wish."

This time, at least — please, let Yui's wish be heard.

That was my only wish. From the bottom of my heart, I prayed to the gods.

After properly conveying my wish to the gods, we walked hand in hand through the shrine grounds.\
We couldn't leave without drawing omikuji fortune slips.

　I plunged my hand into the box and rummaged around. Then I pulled out one that felt right.\
Afterwards, Yui-san quietly drew one too.

My heart pounding, I unwrapped mine. The words "Great Fortune" leapt out at me. I did a little dance and thrust the paper right in front of Yui-san.\
Then, a moment later, Yui-san opened hers and held the paper up to me, smiling happily.

　We tied the two 'Great Fortune' omikuji together, side by side, on a branch within the shrine grounds.

Whether this omikuji will come true, I cannot say. But I want to believe.

Surely this year will be a happy one for both of us.
