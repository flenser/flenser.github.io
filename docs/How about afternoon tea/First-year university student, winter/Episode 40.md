Episode 40: Don't Forget to Tie a Leek Around Your Neck

Before me stood a cake stand. Then, amber-coloured royal milk tea.

'Hotel afternoon tea really is something else,' I marvelled, reaching for a sandwich.

We'd been shown to a window seat by the glass panes, where Yuri's silver hair sparkled, dazzlingly reflecting the sunlight.

Unlike me, who was already about to start eating, Yuri hesitated, her hand hovering uncertainly.

"Um, what should I eat first?"

"From the bottom up... but I reckon you should just eat whatever takes your fancy? We're in Japan, and it's just the two of us."

Saying that, I took a bite of a bite-sized sandwich. Yuri followed suit and reached for one too.

I recalled Yui-san saying something similar when she took me to a hotel dinner before.

　Since we're friends, it's fine as long as it tastes good and we're having fun. Honestly, I doubt many of the girls here for afternoon tea are worrying about such things.

Today, I'd come shopping with Yuri, and I'd suggested we go for afternoon tea in the afternoon.

Making tea at home is nice, but occasionally enjoying it at a hotel is rather lovely too, I thought.

　Yui-san mentioned today was her monthly dinner gathering, so she'd be home late.\
So I'd arranged to hang out with Yuri today, trying to distract myself somehow.

Yuri, who'd been happily tucking into her sandwich, suddenly looked up at me as if remembering something.

"Come to think of it... Kanata, are you going back to England after you graduate?"

The question was so sudden it startled me a little.

"Eh? No, I'm not going back. I plan to find work in Japan. Besides, who knows when my family will return to Japan? Why?"

The reason my family lives in England now is because my father is posted there for work. Depending on his job situation, the family might return to Japan someday.

"Well, Ritsu mentioned she ought to start preparing for job hunting soon, so I just wondered..."

Job hunting... Right. It's that time already. We'll be second-year students next month. Which means Yui and Ritsu are fourth-years.

Yui's final year of university, then.

"That's right. This is her last year. I really ought to get better at things like housework this year too..."

Yui-san already has a job lined up from the start, so she doesn't need to job hunt. Still, once she becomes a working adult, her life won't be as relaxed as it is now, with all this free time.

When that happens, it really wouldn't do to remain a useless burden who can't even manage basic housework.

As I sighed and said this, Yuri narrowed her eyes and smiled.

"So, you mean you haven't been doing any housework at all?"

"W-well... mostly Yui-san does it for me..."

It was true, but being called out on it made me feel rather uncomfortable.

"Huh. Don't say I didn't warn you if you get kicked out of the house one day?"

"Yui-san wouldn't do that! Probably..."

"Senpai, you spoil Kanata a bit too much, don't you."

I was aware of that myself, so I had no retort.

"Still, it was a bit surprising. So you're the type to go all out for your girlfriend, huh?"

"Girlfriend?"

I tilted my head, wondering what she meant, when Yuri narrowed her eyes and gave a mischievous smile.

"You're seeing someone, aren't you?"

"Wh-what are you talking about!?"

Startled, I nearly spat out my tea.

"You don't need to hide it. It's obvious to anyone who sees you. You adore her."

It was the first time someone had pointed it out so objectively. Did I really look like that? Embarrassment made my face flush.

"And Valentine's Day? You were agonising over it so seriously, weren't you? It made me think... love is rather lovely, isn't it?"

Yuri didn't seem prejudiced, but I felt a little uneasy nonetheless.

　What must I look like to someone who isn't like that? Me, being in love with a woman.

"...Do you think it's weird, us being girls?"

A woman falling for another woman... in Japan today, it's not something you can say too loudly. I don't feel ashamed of it now, but I do wonder what those close to me think.

"Why on earth? There's nothing weird about it, is there? I think falling for someone is absolutely wonderful. Gender doesn't matter."

Yuri smiled without a care. Ah, I truly am blessed with good friends, I thought sincerely. My heart felt just a little lighter.

"...But we really aren't dating, you know."

"Oh? But Ritsu-san said it was only a matter of time for those two."

I couldn't help but give a wry smile. So that's how it was. Ritsu-san had noticed my feelings too, it seemed.

Embarrassed, I instinctively covered my face with both hands, only to hear Yuri's teasing laughter.

After enjoying shopping and afternoon tea, I parted ways with Yuri and set off for home.

She'd mentioned there was a dinner party tonight, so Yui-san must already be out. Waiting until evening would be tedious, but I told myself it couldn't be helped.

　Unlocking the door and stepping inside, I noticed the light was on in the living room.

It was already past seven. Perhaps Yui hadn't gone out after all?

As I walked down the hallway and reached for the living room door, I heard voices. Yui's voice. Was she talking to someone?

I quietly opened the door. Yui seemed to be on the phone with someone in the kitchen. Her voice sounded a little hoarser than usual.

"...Sorry about today. Yes, yes, thank you. Right then."

The moment she ended the call, Yui seemed to notice I'd come home.

"Ah, welcome back, Kanata."

Yui gave a slight cough. She seemed a bit under the weather.

"Yui, wasn't there a dinner meeting today?"

"Hmm, yes. I was supposed to, but I felt a bit feverish. I rang my dad and cancelled for today."

Now that she mentioned it, her cheeks did seem redder than usual. I tossed my bag onto the sofa and hurried over to her.

"Did you take your temperature?"

"No, I didn't. I reckoned it'd just make me feel worse."

　I get the feeling, but when I had a cold before, you were the first one to insist on taking my temperature.

"Have you eaten?"

I'd assumed Yui-san had gone to the dinner party, so I'd eaten and come home.

I wish I could look after her like she did for me before, but I can't cook, so I inevitably have to buy something.

"I've no appetite, so I'll skip it. I don't want to pass it on to Kanata, so I'm just going to sleep in my room."

Hearing that, I hurriedly grabbed Yui-san's hand as she staggered unsteadily towards her room.

"What on earth are you saying now? You can't take your medicine without eating. I can't cook for you, but I can at least go and buy something."

"It's alright, really. I'll be fine if I just sleep. I'd rather not pass it on to Kanata."

It might be a bit late, but I think I've realised something. Could it be that Yui-san is actually really bad at being clingy?

Generally speaking, little sisters are supposed to be good at being clingy, but that doesn't seem to apply to Yui-san.

"Right then, Yui, you can just stay in bed for now."

Saying that, I pushed her back into her room. After watching her stagger and collapse onto the bed as if drawn to it, I grabbed the bag I'd flung onto the sofa again.

There's a supermarket nearby. It's within walking distance from here.

At times like this, I truly curse myself from the bottom of my heart for never having done housework before.\
　If only I were the sort of woman who could whip up a simple bowl of rice porridge. But regretting it now won't make me capable overnight.

Anyway, I had to do what I could.

I pulled my phone from my coat pocket and tapped the contacts app.

Honestly, I had absolutely no idea what to buy for her. But even someone like me had a powerful ally.

The call connected after just a few rings.

‘Hellooo? Hello? It’s Ritsu!’

A delightfully cheerful voice came through the phone.

‘It’s Kanata. Sorry to bother you, but I need your help.’

‘Eh? What’s up? What happened?’

‘Yui-san seems to have caught a cold and has a fever, but I’ve no idea what to buy for her.’

　Swallowing my pride, I had no choice but to ask for help. There really was no other way.

It made me realise just how useless I truly was. I couldn't even properly look after someone I liked when they had a cold.

'Ah, where are you heading now?'

"The local supermarket..."

'Hmm, you'll find everything you need there. You can't cook, can you, Kanata-chan?'

"No..."

'It's alright. They've got instant rice porridge and such. Just warm it up in a pot. Grab a few on your way back. Also, if the fever's bad, get some oral rehydration solution... Well, sports drinks would do too, I suppose. Then, apples, fruit, ice cream? Something easy to eat, I guess. And don't forget to wrap a spring onion around their neck.'

The last bit made me burst out laughing. It felt like the slight tension in my heart had eased a little.

"Fufu, spring onions? Do you really think that'll work?"

『What's that supposed to mean? My old granny back in the sticks said so, so it must be true. Just try it and see, even if you think I'm pulling your leg.』

There it was again, "my old granny back in the sticks". I could swear Ritsu-san said something similar when I gave her those black eggs as a souvenir before.

"...Thank you. That's a real help. If Yui doesn't mind, I'll give it a go."

'You're welcome. Give me a ring anytime if you're stuck.'

She really is dependable. I'm so glad I got on well with Ritsu. Truly, it's no wonder Yui trusts her so much.

　By the time I finished the call, I'd arrived at the supermarket just in time.

I picked up a shopping basket, repeating the "things to buy" Ritsu-san had told me over and over in my head, determined not to forget a single one.
