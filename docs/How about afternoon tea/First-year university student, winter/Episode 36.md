Episode 36: I Get Jealous Too, You Know

"So you two are dating after all, aren't you?"

Before I could even say Happy New Year, Ritsu-san blurted that out, sweet rice wine in hand. Startled, I yanked my hand out of Yui-san's pocket where we'd been holding hands.

"Wh-what are you talking about?"

Her usually gentle, hazel-brown eyes narrowed maliciously.

I'd messed up. I knew I'd be meeting Ritsu-san, yet holding hands with Yui-san when we went out had become so routine that it hadn't even occurred to me to let go before meeting Ritsu-san. I deeply, deeply regretted it.

"But you were holding hands just now, weren't you?"

"...Yui-san, you do this with everyone, don't you?"

I blurted it out in desperation. I didn't know if she held hands with everyone, and even if she did, it would be utterly repulsive... but right now, that was all I could say.

"Oh? I've never held hands with Yui, though."

Ritsu said it with an amused laugh, making me so uncomfortable I had to look away.

　I'd had enough. Ritsu-san was just as sharp-tongued as Yui-san, so anything else I said would only dig my own grave, absolutely.

"Ritsu, don't be so hard on Kanata."

Just as I was floundering, Yui-san came to my rescue, and I breathed a sigh of relief.

"Kanata, don't mind what Ritsu says. Shall we hold hands again?"

　Saying that, Yui-san held out her hand in front of me and smiled.

There was no way I could take her hand again in this situation. Wondering what she was thinking, I peered into those dark eyes and realised they were smiling faintly too.

Yui-san, she knew perfectly well Ritsu-san would tease her, yet she kept holding my hand.

　She should have just said something. Like, "I'm meeting Ritsu, so I'll let go of your hand."

How awful. They must be teasing me together.

"...No way. I'm never holding hands again."

I shook my head left and right as I answered, and Ritsu burst out laughing.

"Sorry, sorry, it was just a joke, don't sulk. Holding hands between friends is perfectly normal, right? So next time, you hold my hand. Did you see the stalls? I'll treat you to anything you want as an apology."

With a sharp wink, Ritsu took my hand and pulled me along.

Just as I was starting to feel a little better, my other hand was grabbed tightly, stopping my feet as I tried to take a step forward.

"...Ritsu."

Yui-san's displeased voice made me turn around. I understood what she wanted to say just from her gaze. Ritsu-san, at the end of Yui-san's gaze — waving the hand linked with mine back and forth — grinned maliciously.

"What's the matter? You're not dating, are you? If she's not your girlfriend, then it's fine, isn't it? Right?"

Saying that, Ritsu-san peered into my eyes, smiling like a mischievous child. Caught off guard by her demand for agreement, I nodded reflexively. Yui frowned, clearly annoyed.

"...Kanata."

Eh? Now it's me? What do you want me to do? Ritsu showed no sign of letting go, and Yui's grip on my hand didn't seem likely to loosen either.

She stared intently at me, leaving me flustered and unsure what to do. I looked back and forth between them, utterly confused.

"Yui. If you want Kanata all to yourself, you'll have to wait until you're dating."

With that, Ritsu pulled my hand. This time, Yui's grip came away with surprising ease.

Sighing, Yui gave up and started walking behind us.

Uncharacteristically for her, her dissatisfaction was written all over her face, so I couldn't help but chuckle a little.

"Whereabouts is your hometown, Ritsu-san?"

Holding hands with Ritsu-san, we walked down a street lined with food stalls.

"I'm from Akita. It's a proper heavy snow area. When I took Yui to my family home, she was really shocked, wasn't she?"

Took her to your family home? Hearing that unexpected phrase, I couldn't help but look at Yui-san.

"Yui-san, have you been to Ritsu-san's family home?"

"Yes, I have. Was it the winter of my first year at university?"

"That's right. Yui, you were absolutely thrilled making a snowman, weren't you?"

Akita... Somehow, it felt very like Ritsu. Fair-skinned and beautiful.

They're best friends, so it's probably not unusual for them to have visited each other's homes. I envy their relationship. Honestly, I might just feel a little jealous.

　I'd love to see Yui-san getting excited making snowmen too.

Ritsu-san's left hand, linked with mine, was warm. But I found myself missing the warmth in Yui-san's pocket just a little.

The stall that caught my interest most, completely unrelated to New Year, was the takoyaki one. Sitting on a bench, I took a bite of one as its delicious aroma rose with the steam.

Hmm, delicious.

How many years has it been since I last ate takoyaki? Moments like this, when I encounter food uniquely Japanese, make me glad I came back to Japan.

The six takoyaki disappear one after another into my stomach.

"Kanata-chan, you really do eat with such relish."

"Eh, do I?"

I certainly do enjoy eating, but I think that's the first time anyone's said that to me.

"Yeah, you look absolutely delicious."

"Well then, I'll give the last one to Ritsu-san."

It was Ritsu-san who bought them in the first place, after all. I speared the last one with a toothpick and lifted it up. I was about to feed it to Ritsu-san when suddenly, my hand was snatched away. Startled, I froze for a moment.

　The hand pulling me wasn't Ritsu-san's on my left, but Yui-san's on my right.

While I was dumbfounded, Yui-san popped the takoyaki into her mouth with a smack.

I stared blankly at Yui-san, chewing away. The takoyaki that should have been on the skewer was gone. Vanished.

"Yui-san! I was going to give that to Ritsu-san..."

"Thank you for the treat."

Ritsu laughed out loud at Yui, who smiled brightly.

"Yui, you're being far too childish!"

Yui stuck her tongue out at Ritsu. Sandwiched between the two of them, I felt like I was seeing a side of Yui I'd never seen before. Maybe it was nice to hang out like this together once in a while, I thought.

"That's enough now. Hand Kanata back, won't you?"

Yui-san took my hand as she spoke, and Ritsu-san promptly let go with a "Right then".

Ritsu-san had probably only held my hand to tease Yui-san. As we parted, she whispered in my ear, "That necklace suits you."

　Yui-san noticed my flushed cheeks and pressed her for what she’d said, but Ritsu just laughed it off.

Could Ritsu have noticed how I feel? She must have seen countless women harbouring feelings for Yui-san, so it wouldn’t be surprising if she had.

My hand slipped back into her pocket. Yui-san said, "Let’s head back soon," and I nodded in agreement.

As soon as I settled onto the sofa at home, my arm was suddenly pulled and I was hugged, Yui-san rubbing her cheek against the nape of my neck.

"Um, Yui-san…?"

The arms pulling me closer felt tighter than usual. Finding it odd, I glanced over and saw Yui-san smiling brightly.

　Her grip tightened, holding me firmly. She was smiling, but the strength in those arms holding me felt somehow mismatched with that smile.

"...Do you always hold hands with your friends, Kanata?"

"Eh..."

With friends? Hands? With Yuri and the others? I shook my head vigorously from side to side.

"I don't..."

"Then why did you hold hands with Ritsu today? You could have refused."

Her dark eyes fixed on me, not smiling. Wait, is Yui-san angry...?

"Wh-why? But Ritsu-san..."

My excuses trailed off, my voice growing quiet. When I lowered my gaze, Yui-san's finger lifted my chin, forcing me to look at her. Our gazes collided. Escape seemed forbidden.

"But, refusing in that situation... wouldn't that have been weird...? Besides, I always hold hands with Yui-san too..."

"So, to Kanata, am I and Ritsu the same?"

I flinched. Of course not. They weren't the same. Not knowing what to say, I fell silent. Yui-san furrowed her beautiful brow.

"...So, Kanata, if asked, you'd do this sort of thing with Ritsu too?"

"Eh...?"

Mmmph. A kiss stole my words. My shoulders were pushed, and my back sank onto the sofa with startling ease.

The heat-filled kiss sent tingling sensations rippling through the back of my head.

　Her soft tongue traced my lips, and reflexively, I parted mine just a little. Instantly, her tongue slipped inside, tangling with mine. The sensation sent shivers down my spine.

Would I do this sort of thing with Ritsu too? Of course not. I knew that perfectly well.

Her arms tightened around me, almost as if venting some uncontrollable jealousy. I couldn't bear it and wrapped my arms around her neck, pulling her closer.

　When my breath grew short and ragged, her tongue withdrew. She licked her wet lips with a wet smack and looked down at me with those dark eyes. I stared back, refusing to be outdone.

"...I don't think... Ritsu-san... would do something like this..."

My chest rising and falling, I gasped out those words. Ritsu-san isn't homosexual, nor is she as light-hearted as Yui-san.

"...If she did it, I'm asking whether you'd accept it."

Gently, Yui-san's fingers traced a path from the nape of my neck, gliding down to the diamond at my décolletage.

"...I worked so hard to earn your permission to kiss Kanata. You're saying it like it's the same as being with Ritsu."

She scowled like a child, furrowing her brow as she said it, and I couldn't help but laugh.

Yui-san is usually so composed, but despite appearances, I think she has quite a cute side.

"...Why are you laughing? I'm being serious."

She looked displeased at being laughed at, so I pulled her closer with my arm around her neck and gazed into her sulky dark eyes.

"I don't do this sort of thing with just anyone. You're special, Yui. So please forgive me... for today."

Yui's sulky eyes finally softened.

　She hugged me so tightly it hurt, and I felt relieved, thinking, Good, she forgave me.

I think I was in the wrong today.

If Yui-san were to hold hands with my friend right in front of me, I'd absolutely hate it and get upset too.

Well, in my case, I probably wouldn't be as patient as Yui-san, so I doubt I could hold back my dissatisfaction all the way home.

"...Yui-san has a cute side too, you know."

Chuckling softly as I said that, Yui-san lifted her face and stared intently at me.\
I gently stroked the glossy black hair falling down, tucking it behind her ear. My fingertips brushed against her earring, so I kept stroking it.

"...I get jealous too, you know."

"Do you like me that much?"

I asked deliberately, wanting to hear her say it. Make her tell me. I slid the fingers that had been stroking her earlobe gently, touching her soft lips.

"...I like you. I've said it loads of times, haven't I?"

My hand, which had been touching her lips, was taken, and our lips met once more.

Deep within my chest, a warmth slowly spread. Just hearing her say she liked me made me feel this incredibly happy.

　A kiss on my neck made my body flinch. Just as I thought she'd gently lick it, she sucked harder, stinging slightly.

This sensation felt familiar. Just like when Yui-san left a love bite on me at the hot springs.

"Yui-san, if you suck that hard, you'll leave a mark."

"...I'm doing it because I want to leave one."

"B-but aren't love bites something lovers do, or people who have sex...?"

"Exactly. It means Kanata is mine."

Even though she wouldn't even go out with me, how dare she say something like that. Even thinking that, I unexpectedly felt a pang at the possessiveness directed at me, and couldn't bring myself to refuse.

In the end, Yui-san didn't cheer up all day that day, clinging to my body and refusing to let go.

After that, two more love bites appeared, and the next day I found myself sighing deeply in front of the mirror, concealer in hand.
