Episode 38: Will You Marry Me?

Valentine's Day was fast approaching on a certain fine day.

I was at the department store's Valentine's Fair with Yuri. Naturally, I was the one who invited her. The purpose was to choose chocolates to give to Yui-san.

We browsed each chocolate specialist stall in turn. I don't think Yui-san particularly likes things that sweet, so perhaps something a bit more sophisticated would suit her.

"You're taking your time, aren't you?"

Yuri grinned as she popped a sample chocolate into her mouth. Since winter, her trademark blonde hair had somehow turned silver. Apparently, she'd dyed it to match her favourite idol's hair colour.

"Aren't you giving any to anyone, Yuri?"

Though she'd come along with me, she didn't seem to be planning to buy anything herself. She was nibbling samples, but didn't look like she was seriously choosing anything.

"Well, I don't really have anyone I like, so I don't plan on giving any to anyone."

"Eh? Then why did you come with me today?"

"Well, obviously because Kanata invited me. So? Why are you taking so long choosing chocolate for your senior?"

Caught off guard by her bluntness, I faltered. I hadn't even mentioned who I was choosing chocolate for, yet she'd seen right through me from the start.

　To hide my embarrassment, I cleared my throat with a cough.

"...Well, Yui-san, you know, she gets chocolates from all sorts of people..."

"I'd heard rumours, but getting chocolates during spring break? That's quite something."

Yes, Yui-san was even more popular than the rumours suggested. At first, I'd thought spring break meant fewer chances to meet other girls.

"...Yui-san goes out drinking quite a lot, doesn't she? I reckon she gets them there. Even before Valentine's, she'd already brought home five."

Even if her habit of staying out all night had calmed down, she hadn't completely stopped going out at night. Of course, the frequency had dropped dramatically compared to before, and since Ritsu-san was also at the drinking gatherings, it wasn't really a problem.

　"That's quite something," Yuri chuckled. But it really wasn't a laughing matter. I ended up eating all the chocolates Yui-san brought home, but the problem was that every single one was a well-known, high-end brand.

So, I'm in a fix. I absolutely hate being lumped together with the masses.

"Why not just make some yourself?"

"...I'm not very good at that sort of thing."

Shop-bought chocolates are definitely tastier. Besides, if I were to make chocolates while living together, I reckon it'd be spotted in an instant.

After all, I hardly ever set foot in the kitchen.

"It'll be fine. She'll be happy with whatever you give her."

I know that. Yui-san would probably be delighted even with a box of Tirol chocolates. But still, just picking something random feels wrong. Valentine's Day is supposed to be the day you give chocolate to someone you like, after all.

Since I can't prepare homemade chocolates filled with my feelings, I at least want to choose something seriously.

"Hmm... I know, but—"

　I groaned in frustration, and Yuri laughed, giving my shoulder a light pat.

"Well, agonise over it all you like. Come on, let's do another lap. I'll spend the whole day with you, you lovesick girl."

She teased me like that, but I'm sure Yuri would understand how I feel someday when she falls for someone too.

Since she was going out of her way to help me pick chocolates, I couldn't really complain.

　In the end, after two more laps around the shop, I settled on chocolates wrapped in a cute red box.

Since I’d be giving these to her on the day, I’d have to hide them somewhere Yui couldn’t see.

＊＊＊

It was nine o’clock at night when I received a message from Yui, who’d been out drinking, saying she was on her way home. She opened the door just after ten.

　"Welcome home," I called, rushing over. "I'm home," she replied, wrapping one arm around me. I nuzzled her neck, inhaling deeply to confirm the scent of her perfume. This was a check. Good. The perfume hadn't faded, and no other scents mingled with it.

Yui was carrying two unfamiliar paper bags in one hand. My keen eyes immediately spotted that both contained chocolates.

　Unaware of my gaze, Yui-san placed the chocolates on the coffee table and settled into her usual prime seat.

I followed suit, sitting down beside her.

I know because I went to the Valentine's Fair today. These are the really expensive ones.

"...You were late today, weren't you?"

"Ah, I got held up on the way back, ended up taking longer than I thought."

I stare at Yui as she removes her piercing.

"Held up," she says. By what? She was invited out, wasn't she? To a hotel? Or a girl's place? I swallow hard, suppressing the urge to confront her.

　Even if she was invited, she properly turned it down and came home. Still, it was a bit annoying.

"...That makes seven, doesn't it?"

"Eh?"

I pointed at the one sitting proudly on the table. Yui-san looked at the chocolate, her expression shifting to one of understanding.

"Honestly, Yui-san, you're really popular, aren't you?"

"Not at all. They're all just obligatory chocolates."

"Hmm...?"

"You can have it if you like?"

Yui probably thinks I've eaten all the chocolates she's received so far because I love chocolate.

Well, if you put it like that. I took the wrapped pink box out of the paper bag. I picked up the small message card sandwiched between the brown ribbon and opened it.

"Ah."

"'To Yui-san, I love you. Let's hang out again sometime. I'm always waiting for you'... it says."

I waved the card flutteringly in front of Yui-san's eyes. That message card, covered in hearts, was definitely not the sort you'd attach to obligatory chocolates.

She seemed to have not noticed the card was there at all, and I could tell she looked flustered as her gaze darted around.

"This is obligatory? Hmm... Seems rather different from the obligatory chocolates I know."

"No, well... Kanata, this is..."

"White Day's going to be tough, isn't it?"

Smiling sweetly and delivering the sarcastic remark, Yui-san snatched the message card still in my hand and flung it onto the table. Then she gently took my hand, her dark eyes studying me as if gauging my mood.

"I won't give it back. I said that from the start."

"...Hmm. Really?"

"Really. I clearly said I couldn't reciprocate their feelings."

Hearing that, I briefly thought how shocking it would be if I'd given Yui-san chocolate and she'd said that to me.

I feel a little scared. There are moments when I wonder what if, to Yui-san, I'm just like those other girls.

So then, Yui-san, who exactly are you giving the chocolate to?

Just as I was about to say that, a name flashed through my mind. An image of someone I'd never even seen, purely imagined, appeared in my mind and wouldn't fade.

"...Yui-san, are you giving the chocolate to Kitakami-san?"

　The moment I blurted out that name, unable to hold back, Yui-san's eyes widened slightly in surprise.

"Eh? Why?"

"Just a thought. Because you always get presents, don't you? I just wondered if, since it's someone of the opposite sex, you'd give something back at a time like this."

That person, who gives Yui-san expensive presents every time – on her birthday, at Christmas. Someone whose face I've never seen.

　Valentine's Day inevitably feels like a romantic event... but would he give her something? If so, I'd hate it. Terribly.

"I won't give him anything."

Yui shook her head from side to side, as if dismissing my worries. Thank goodness. I felt a little relieved. I'd been dreading what she might say if she did give me something.

"...You've been really preoccupied with Shinji lately. Why?"

"Eh? Do I seem preoccupied?"

"Yeah, you do."

She gently stroked our joined hands, her eyes fixed on me as if trying to see straight through my heart. I love Yui-san's eyes like this. Eyes like the night sea – calm, deep black. I adore these eyes that try to understand my heart, utterly and completely.

Saying I wasn't concerned would be a lie. Why I was concerned? I didn't know. Probably just a woman's intuition. Nothing but instinct. So I couldn't explain the reason. But it was a definite sense of unease.

"Hey, why? Tell me, Kanata."

She called my name, urging an answer, but I wouldn't say. I wouldn't say, even though I had no reason to feel this way.

"...Yui-san."

"Hm?"

"...I'm hungry. Make something."

At my sudden, unexpected words, Yui-san's eyes widened in surprise.

"Eh? What's that? Kanata, aren't you terribly bad at covering things up?"

I pulled her hand as she laughed out loud, "Ahaha". If she'd noticed I was trying to cover it up, I wish she wouldn't be so mean and just let me get away with it by staying silent.

"Just hurry up and make us a late-night snack."

"It's already ten o'clock, you know? Are you really that hungry?"

Those mischievous eyes peering into mine. She absolutely knows I'm jealous, yet she plays along.

"I am hungry. I want grilled rice balls. The ones you made for me before."

"Oh, for heaven's sake... Fine then. But in return, make me a highball. I'm starting over with the drinks now."

　Yui-san smiled happily. So I stood up too, following her as she headed towards the kitchen.

I've never said it, but I actually like watching Yui-san like this, drinking a highball in the kitchen while making a late-night snack.

I love seeing her like that so much that I sometimes deliberately request a late-night snack just to see it. It's a side of you only I know, and I truly cherish it.

"It won't take long, you can sit down if you like?"

"...I'll wait here."

"You must have been really hungry."

That was part of it. But I wanted to keep watching. Because I was sure this was a side of her she only showed to me.

"...The man who marries Yui-san will be very lucky."

The words slipped out, my true feelings spilling from my lips. Yui-san's hand, which had been about to flip the rice ball, froze for just an instant.

"...Why?"

After a short pause, Yui-san said this without taking her eyes off the frying pan.

"You're perfect at housework and cooking, beautiful, kind... the ideal wife, right?"

"Marriage, eh. I've never really wanted it."

"Eh? Why not?"

"...Well, I just can't fall for men."

Her profile looked so terribly lonely it made my chest ache. I hadn't meant to say it like that. True, same-sex marriage isn't possible in Japan right now, but still.

"...Why assume you'd marry a man? Maybe in the future, women will be able to marry each other."

At that, Yui laughed out loud.

"Ahaha, what on earth? Are you serious?"

"I'm not joking... I really mean it. Someday, that future might come, couldn't it?"

The savoury aroma of burnt soy sauce filled the air. The flipped rice ball was a delicious, golden brown.

Truly, I said it because I thought whoever marries Yui-san would be happy. It wasn't because I imagined her beside some other man.

I didn't want her to look so... lonely.

"...Yes, I suppose so. That would be nice. So, if that future comes, will you marry me?"

"Eh...?"

Startled, I stared at Yui-san. Her gentle eyes were fixed on me.

"Because the woman who marries me will be happy, won't she? So I'll make you happy, Kanata."

My heart pounded wildly. Wasn't this practically a proposal? My face grew hot. Could anyone hear something like this from the person they liked and not feel happy?

"I... I don't think I'd make a good wife. I'm hopeless at housework and everything."

"That's fine. You don't have to. Just being by my side is enough."

"Well then... I'll... think about it..."

As I squeezed those words out, Yui laughed aloud again.

　I took a bite of the crispy, fragrant grilled rice ball. Across the dining table, Yui watched me with a smile, sipping her highball.

"Maybe I should become a politician."

"Eh? Suddenly? What's that about?"

A politician? Why? A question mark flew above my head.

"To change Japanese law. So I can marry you."

She said it with a bright smile, but whether it was a joke or serious, Yui-san was still impossible to read.

"...If you ever cheat on me, I'll take compensation and divorce you."

I said it to hide my embarrassment, and Yui-san laughed happily.

"I won't cheat on you. I may look like this, but I'm actually very devoted. I'll always treasure you."

What a thing to say. But I hope that future really does come.

Then, just as we promised at Christmas, we'll definitely go on our honeymoon somewhere where the stars are beautiful.

To a beautiful resort island surrounded by emerald green waters, floating in the Indian Ocean.
