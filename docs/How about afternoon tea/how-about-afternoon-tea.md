## Description

What on earth does sex feel like when it's so good you want to bite?

Kanata Aosawa is a first-year university student. Upon entering university, she began sharing a flat with Yui Ichinose, a third-year at the same university and the daughter of her father's friend. But soon after moving in, she discovered a shocking truth. That Yui was a "lesbian" and notorious for her promiscuous behaviour with women.
