Episode 66: How about afternoon tea?

Returning to my desk in the Budget Management Department with a stern expression, everyone abruptly rose from their chairs and rushed over to me.

Manager Yamazato peered at my face with concern.

"Aosawa-san, how did it go?"

"I was told to reconsider. It didn't go well."

I slumped my shoulders and answered honestly. To say I wasn't downhearted would be a lie. While how Yui-san felt was entirely a gamble, I honestly hadn't anticipated being told so firmly that it was no good.

"Aosawa-chan, there's no need to be downhearted."

Mitsuya-san patted my back encouragingly, as if to comfort me. It felt strangely nostalgic. Back when I was a new recruit, Mitsuya-san would pat me on the back like this every time I made a mistake, to cheer me up.

"But then, why didn't they just reject you at the document screening stage? Why did they go out of their way to call in Aosawa-san specifically?"

"It's puzzling," Manager Yamazato tilted her head. Then, Seno-san, who'd been silent until now, gave a faint smile and said,

"There are still three days left, aren't there? It's too early to give up. Why not barge into the president's office every day? After all, you're the only one who got called in. I reckon she's interested."

"Barging in...? What on earth are you talking about? I couldn't possibly do that!"

Mitsuya-san glared at Seno-san with sharp eyes, looking utterly exasperated.

Still, Seno-san just laughed, unfazed.

"Oh?　If you don't act, it'll just end there. It's like playing the dating game, isn't it? If it seems hopeless, you just back off quickly."

Like playing the dating game, huh. Right, that way of thinking does make sense. But...

"...I'm really bad at that sort of thing. What should I do?"

Saying this with a troubled look, Seno-san pursed her plump lips and gave a faint smile.

"Simple. Aosawa-san, you said you had someone you liked, right? Just imagine the president is that person and go all out for the next three days."

"Listen, could you stop teasing Aosawa-chan so much? She's a serious girl."

"Oh, come off it, Mitsuya-san. I'm not teasing her, am I? I'm just giving Aosawa-san some concrete advice that stiff old Mitsuya-san couldn't possibly offer."

Ignoring the pair snarling at each other, I stood with my arms crossed, deep in thought. Then Manager Yamazato gave my shoulder a light tap.

A gentle, warm sensation spread from his palm.

"Seno-san might have a point. It could be a chance to put yourself out there. Relax, give it your all without regrets. It's alright if you fail. You'll always have a place to come back to."

Hearing that, I nodded. When it came to Yui-san, I still had one person left to turn to in times of trouble. The person who knew Yui-san's character best, her closest friend.

——I've something I'd like to discuss. Could we meet today?

I sent that via chat app, and the reply came back immediately.

＊＊＊

Seven o'clock. Ritsu appeared at the izakaya we'd arranged to meet at, looking sharp as ever. Her nimble footwork, then and now, hadn't changed a bit.

Her hair, now a calmer brown than in her student days, suited her grey trouser suit perfectly. A proper banker. Sharp and smart.

Though Ritsu might seem frivolous with her flashy appearance, she’s incredibly diligent at heart. On top of that, she’s what you’d call a ‘social skills monster’.

After being shown to a private room, Ritsu ordered beer first thing. She downed the mug in one go, as if washing away the day’s fatigue, pouring the beer straight into her stomach.

"So, what's this you want to discuss? Has that girl done something again?"

I began nibbling on a salmon rice ball while sipping my lemon sour.

"It's not that. Actually... well, there's been a lot going on, and right now I'm running for Yui-san's secretary position within the company, but she's being really reluctant. I was wondering if there's any way to persuade her."

"Ah, come to think of it, she did mention something about that. Getting a secretary or something. Yui's been busy lately, hasn't she? She calls occasionally, but she never invites me out for drinks anymore."

Ritsu-san said this while popping a salted edamame pod into her mouth. So they still go out drinking together. Seems the two of them are still as close as ever.

"That's why I'm saying I want to be her secretary, but Yui-san is reluctant. It's completely backwards, you see."

Hmm, well, I can pretty much guess what she's thinking... For Yui, work is just a means to an end. She wants to meet Kanata-chan privately, not for work. But Kanata-chan, are you absolutely set on becoming her secretary?

"Yes. Because if I become her secretary, I'll be with her all the time. And if some other girl becomes her secretary and it turns into a romance..."

　Pouting as I said this, Ritsu-san ordered some karaage on the tablet while shaking her head with a laugh.

"Ahaha, no way. That's absolutely not going to happen. Because that girl is head over heels for Kanata-chan. And you know, Yui was actually planning to go see Kanata-chan after breaking off her engagement anyway."

"Eh?"

That was news to me. The warmth spreading through my chest surely wasn't just from the alcohol. If it were true... I'd be happy. I bit my lip hard to stop myself from smiling.

"That's why she was so anxious about getting results in three years. Every time Yui got drunk, she'd go on about how 'I have to hurry or Kanata will marry someone else' — it was a pain."

"Is that... really so?"

　I'm happy. Yui-san cared about me that much. Even though I was a coward who ran away without even trying to fight.

"Even so, do you still absolutely want to be her secretary?"

But even if I heard that, I...

I nodded to that question. After all, it's best for me to be by Yui-san's side. Especially if she's made an effort for my sake.

"I don't want to give it up to anyone else. Because I probably couldn't stand the jealousy either..."

"Ah ha, what's that? How adorable."

"Don't tease me... I'm serious. Ritsu-san, doesn't Yui-san have any weaknesses?"

"Weaknesses? That's obvious. Look, right here."

Saying that, Ritsu pointed straight at me. A weakness... me?

"Why not try using your charms? That womaniser's been living a life of abstinence for four years. If Kanata-chan made a move, she'd be a goner for sure. Overkill, really."

Ritsu laughed mockingly, cackling away.

"W-what are you saying? Honestly, Ritsu!"

Back in our student days, Yui-san was the sort of person who seemed to regard having sex with girls as a hobby. So even after we parted ways, I'd been anxious, wondering if it was really possible she'd never been with anyone else. But learning that after that incident, Yui-san had completely given up her womanising ways made me truly, deeply happy.

　I could feel my cheeks burning hot, so I gulped down my lemon sour to hide it.

But... seduction tactics? Impossible for me. The difference in experience between us is just too great.

After laughing heartily for a while, Ritsu wiped the tears welling at the corners of her eyes with her index finger and said.

"If that's impossible, well... you've got three days left, haven't you? If you can't manage it by the deadline... I've got a good plan. But this is a last resort."

I leaned forward, pleading, "Tell me!" Ritsu grinned like a child who'd thought up a mischievous scheme.

＊＊＊

The contest would be decided in the remaining three days. If I could make Yui-san say, "Well, I suppose I have no choice," I'd win. If I couldn't overturn her 'no', I'd lose.

If I couldn't persuade her by the deadline, even if I passed the document screening thanks to Manager Yamazato's recommendation, I'd likely be rejected in the interview.

I needed to settle the contest before another candidate was chosen. This was a short-term battle.

　The following afternoon. Clattering to my feet from my desk, teacup in hand.

"Manager Yamazato. Might I take a short break?"

Upon my request, she kindly replied, "Yes, of course. Go ahead."

The other two weren't at their desks, but given the time, Mitsuya-san should be returning from her cigarette break soon, and Seno-san rarely takes short breaks, so I assumed she was simply away from her desk.

　On my way out of the office towards the kitchenette, I bumped straight into Seno-san. So, it wasn't a break after all. Had she been to the loo?

Mitsuya-san had said before that "Seno-san lacks motivation"... but even so, she doesn't take that many breaks, and somehow, it feels like Seno-san spends the most time at her desk.

"Aosawa-san, taking a break?"

Seeing me holding a tea set and a small tray, Seno-san tilted her head.

"Yes. ...I thought I'd try out the advice you gave me."

At that, Seno-san gave a sly smile.

"I see. The president's rich and beautiful... I reckon she's got plenty of suitors, but I think you'd stand a good chance, Aosawa-san. I gave up because it seemed hopeless for me."

"Eh?"

I stiffened, straightening my back involuntarily. I recalled the welcome party. At that time, Seno-san had pulled Yui-san's arm tightly towards her. Could that have been... an approach after all...?

"Well then, good luck."

With that, Seno-san breezed past me and headed back into the office.\
Just then, a scent wafted over me – one I'd never noticed from her before, yet somehow familiar, like I'd smelt it on someone else. I tilted my head.

　Just as I started walking towards the kitchenette, Mitsuya-san, who seemed to be returning from the rooftop, came down the corridor from the other end.

This building doesn't have a smoking room, so smokers have no choice but to go up to the rooftop, whether it's a scorching summer day like today or a day of torrential rain.\
Mitsuya-san always said smokers had it rough.

"Oh, Aosawa-chan. Off for a break now?"

In her hand, she held a cigarette packet and a silver... what was it? A lighter? I think Mitsuya-san mentioned collecting these was a hobby of hers.

"Yes, just taking a short break."

"Got it. Off you go then."

Watching Mitsuya-san walk away, waving her hand flutteringly, I realised something. Ah.

　It smelled the same as the scent I'd noticed from Seno-san earlier. Oh, right. That was the smell of tobacco.

"...Does Seno-san smoke, then...?"

Well, never mind. Maybe I just didn't know. More importantly, I had to get to the kitchenette now. Clutching the tea set tightly, I started walking again.

　From my pouch, I took out the portioned tea leaves and the single-serving pot. Alongside them, I placed two macarons on a small plate – ones I'd discreetly stashed in the pantry fridge that morning.

　Today's tea leaves were an Afternoon Blend. Perfect for a midday breather.

I poured tea into a single teacup, then temporarily placed the teapot on a shelf. Nobody ever uses the kitchenette anyway.

Taking the tray, I walked back towards the office. My destination: the president's office. Passing by the Budget Management Department's desks, I knocked on the thick door I'd only entered for the first time yesterday.

Several people looked at me curiously, but what they thought now didn't matter. I didn't care. I had to do what I could. Thinking about what might happen after failing was pointless anyway.

"Please come in," Yui-san's voice said, and I placed my hand on the doorknob.

　As the door swung open, Yui-san, seated at her desk chair, looked up at me and her eyes widened in surprise.

I'll prove I'm serious too. No time for appearances. Once I decide to do something, I give it my all.

So, closing the door behind me with one hand, I smiled brightly and said:

"President, how about some afternoon tea?"
