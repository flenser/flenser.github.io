Episode 67: Please, Don't Say We Won't Meet Again

Yui-san let go of the ballpoint pen in surprise, and it rolled onto the desk with a clatter.\
Ignoring Yui-san, who stared at me blankly with a look that said she had no idea what was happening, I stepped right up beside her.

"It's getting on a bit now. Fancy a little break?"

"A break?"

Yui glanced down at her wristwatch. It was half past three – the perfect time for afternoon tea. I'd deliberately chosen this hour to come to the president's office.

My eyes flickered towards the wastepaper basket beside the desk. A crumpled jelly drink container lay discarded inside.\
Seems she hasn't been eating proper lunches lately either.

　I placed a saucer and teacup on the desk, along with a small plate holding two macarons. Then, extending my palm towards the bewildered Yui, I said, "Here you are."

"Just until you finish your tea. Please give me your time. I want you to properly understand how serious I am."

I met her gaze directly. Yui then lowered her eyes to the tea set on the desk.

"...It smells lovely, doesn't it?"

"It's an Afternoon Blend. The macarons aren't overly sweet either, so I think you'll like them. It seemed like you haven't been taking any breaks lately..."

"And this is for me?"

Nodding, Yui smiled happily and said, "Thank you."

"Well, President. I do observe things, don't I?"

　She said this with her chest puffed out, then pouted her lips slightly, looking a little displeased.

"Stop calling me President. When it's just the two of us, call me by my name like you always do."

"...I thought you wanted to keep work and private life completely separate."

I'd assumed she didn't want me as her secretary because she didn't want to mix business with pleasure. So my plan was to show her I was the type who could keep things properly separate.\
　But it seemed she, the person in question, didn't take kindly to it.

"That's all well and good... but I want you to call me by my name, Kanata."

Her unusually hesitant tone made me tilt my head. Still, it was a welcome request for me too. I'd wanted to call her by her name if I could.

"If that's what you say, Yui-san, then I understand. ...Anyway, drink it while it's still warm. It'll get cold."

Upon prompting her, Yui-san said, "I'll have some," and took a sip from her teacup.\
I like this tea, but I wonder how Yui-san feels about it. It's actually much, much better with milk, but I'll save that for another time — I'll brew it for her at her place.

"...Ah, this is delicious."

Seeing Yui-san gaze at her teacup in surprise, I silently pumped my fist in triumph — it seemed to have worked.

"If you made me your secretary, we might even have time to enjoy tea together like this."

Seizing the moment to make my pitch, Yui-san smiled at my desperate earnestness.

"But surely we could do that even if Kanata wasn't my secretary?"

Her white fingertips plucked a single macaron. Then, beckoning me over with a few quick taps, she gently offered it to me.

"Here. I'll give you one too."

"Eh? No, really. That's yours..."

"But you bought these because you like them too, didn't you? Let's share."

Her smile threw me off balance. I always wonder why she's so kind.

After a moment's thought, I stared at the macaron, then succumbed to temptation and took a bite of the one she offered.\
　Yui followed suit, taking a bite of the pistachio macaron.

"You're right, it's not too sweet and really tasty."

"I'll prepare some more delicious sweets tomorrow too, so look forward to it."

At that, Yui smiled awkwardly.

"Tomorrow too? ...Kanata, you really don't intend to withdraw?"

"Of course. I'll keep persuading you until you say it's alright. Do you mind? Me coming to the president's office?"

I wouldn't tolerate any ambiguity. Pressing her relentlessly, Yui finally resigned herself with a small sigh.

"Of course I don't mind. Seeing your face makes me happy."

"If you make me your secretary, you'll see my face until you're sick of it."

"I could never tire of seeing it. Because I think you're the most adorable person in the whole world."

Her earnest gaze nearly knocked me off my feet. She looked straight at me and delivered that smooth line of flirtation so effortlessly, leaving me speechless. I shouldn't be pushed around like this.

My cheeks felt hot. My face must surely be flushed. Yui-san smiled at me like this and took another sip of her tea.

No, no, I mustn't let myself get swept along by Yui-san's pace like this.\
Finishing this cup of tea will be over in a flash. My precious opportunity to make an impression is slipping away.

"If I hire a secretary, I'll have more time. Then, as promised, we can go to the aquarium together, can't we? I'll take you anywhere you want to go."

In a calm tone, Yui-san said this to me, as if admonishing me.

"But that... I could do it, couldn't I, if I became your secretary?"

It's simply a matter of her sharing some of her workload with me, so her burden would lessen.\
In fact, if I worked around Yui-san's schedule, it would be easier for us to coordinate our days off.\
Thinking that way, I found it harder and harder to see why I wouldn't be suitable.

"Even if you becoming my secretary made things easier for me, you'd end up busier than you are now. I don't want you pushing yourself, so it's no good."

"...But you're pushing yourself, yet I'm not allowed to?"

Having said that much, Yui-san tilted her teacup slightly towards me. It was empty inside. That meant time's up.

"Thank you for the meal. It was absolutely delicious."

Time's up for today. I wanted to press on, but a promise is a promise. Being unable to keep time is fatal for a secretary, so I had no choice but to back down quietly.

"...I'll come again tomorrow."

Yui-san placed the empty teacup on the tray and slumped her shoulders.

"My apologies..."

As I turned to leave the president's office, head bowed, a voice called my name from behind: "Kanata." I turned.\
Her eyes, fixed on me, softened slightly.

"It was nice talking to you. I can't make you my secretary, but do come by again sometime."

With that, Yui-san gave a mischievous smile. I stuck out my tongue and reluctantly left the president's office.

　Today... well, it couldn't be helped. It was my first day, and there's always tomorrow. Tomorrow, for sure.

That's what I thought — but the next day, at the same time, even my desperate appeal, rare cheesecake in hand, as I barged into the president's office, didn't make Yui-san budge an inch.

＊＊＊

Before I knew it, the final day for applications had arrived. If I didn't get a positive response today, it would be game over.

Yui's a fool. I knew it, but she's as stubborn as ever. I'd hoped to persuade her using straightforward methods before resorting to my 'secret weapon', but it seems that notion was rather naive.

It's nearly time for afternoon tea. Today I brought my favourite cream puffs.

I mustn't lose heart. I tell myself that, but my unease only grows stronger.\
　Sighing and hanging my head, Seno-san, seated diagonally opposite, looked up from her monitor and met my gaze.

"Aosawa-san, are you off to see the president again today?"

"Yes... But since yesterday and the day before didn't work out... today's my last chance."

"I see. Well, having pushed this far, pulling back might be a tactic too."

　Seno-san's lips curved into a faint smile. But Yui-san is generally quite straightforward, so I think she's the type who doesn't chase after those who leave... Even if I did back off, I'm half-convinced it wouldn't work.

I'm utterly hopeless at this sort of manoeuvring. I'm well aware I'm clumsy at love, so I envy people like Seno-san who are so adept.\
But there's no point regretting now what I can't do.

　Let's go. To Yui-san. Resolved, I gave my cheek a sharp tap. It's alright, I still have that 'secret weapon' passed down directly from Ritsu-san.

With the seniors' encouragement behind me, I gathered my resolve and stood up.

Holding the tray, I stood before the president's office. Taking a deep breath, I knocked on the door. Hearing Yui-san's voice from inside saying 'Come in', I steeled myself and opened the door.\
　The moment Yui-san saw my face, she smiled happily, "I've been waiting for you."

"Today I made cream puffs. These are my recommendation too."

The outside was crisp cookie dough, the inside not overly sweet custard. Yui-san isn't particularly fond of sweet things, so that aspect had been carefully considered.

"So, Yui-san. Today's the last day for applications, but how many have you had?"

I asked casually. Yui-san paused, as if thinking, then replied, "About thirty, I suppose."\
Honestly, that many was more than I'd imagined. I clutched the tray in my hands tightly.

"And how many are you putting through to the document screening?"

"Five so far."

To state clearly that there are five candidates means the list must already be finalised. Whether I'm on it or not, I cannot say.\
But either way, I believe it's over if I can't overturn this decision here and now.

"Yui-san... why won't you choose me?"

Those dark eyes looked at me. There was no hesitation there. I sensed a strong resolve that this decision would absolutely not be overturned.

"...I'm glad you feel that way, but the reason is as I've said many times before. If Kanata gets busy too, it would be pointless."

Faced with that blunt statement, I pouted, my lips tightening. Why couldn't she understand my feelings?

"...You stubborn fool, Yui-san."

"I won't change my mind, no matter what you say."

If Yui-san insists on being so stubborn, then fine. I'll abandon any naive thoughts of a straightforward approach.

"...Very well, I've had enough. If that's how you feel, I won't go on any more dates with you. Outside of work, I won't see you at all from now on!"

Having stated that clearly, I turned on my heel towards the door.

"Eh!? Wait, just wait a moment! That's completely different from what we're talking about, isn't it!?"

Then, with a clatter, Yui-san stood up and hurriedly grabbed my hand as I tried to leave the president's office, stopping me.\
I turned around and glared sharply at Yui-san, who was looking around frantically with a panicked expression.

"Because you don't want to be with me, right? If that's the case, then it's fine."

"Of course I don't want to be apart from you. The whole secretary thing... I just wanted to make time for us..."

I stared into Yui's eyes as she lowered her eyebrows in a troubled expression, trying to explain.\
I knew this would upset her. That's why I'd rather not have used this 'last resort', but now it was unavoidable.

Yui squeezed my hand tightly.

"...Please, don't say you won't see me anymore."

Seeing Yui looking utterly crestfallen made my heart ache sharply.

—If you say you won't see her unless she becomes your secretary, I reckon Yui'll do anything you ask.

I recalled Ritsu's face as she said that, smiling mischievously. It seemed Ritsu had been right.

I'm sorry for saying I wouldn't see you when I never meant it. But I'll do my absolute best to prove myself useful, so just this once... please forgive my selfishness.

"So, will you make me your secretary? If you promise, I'll take it back."

"...Kanata. That's rather underhanded."

"Underhanded is fine. Because if I'm your secretary, we'll go on business trips together, won't we?　I absolutely don't want to let any other girl have that."

My true feelings spilled out. Yui-san looked down at me, her eyes widening in surprise.

"...That's your real reason for applying? Could it be... you were jealous?"

Caught out, I fell silent and looked down. I knew I was saying something troublesome. But I couldn't help it.\
　Anyone would find it unpleasant if the person they liked chose someone else over them.

Yui-san must know about my selfish nature too.

After a brief silence, Yui-san gave a small chuckle. Why are you laughing? Looking up in confusion, I found Yui-san staring at me with surprisingly gentle eyes.

"I'm sorry I didn't realise. ...When you say something so adorable, I simply can't refuse."

Saying that, her gentle palm stroked my cheek.

"Really? Then will you make me your secretary?"

"...If that's what you want, then yes. I'm glad you're jealous, but I'd never choose someone else just to make you feel bad. But in return, can you promise me you won't push yourself too hard?"

Saying this, Yui-san relaxed her shoulders and gave a soft laugh. So I nodded immediately.

"Right then, I'll get back to work."

I was overjoyed that she'd promised to take me on as her secretary. From now on, I could work right by Yui-san's side.\
Right now, I felt like I could do anything.

　With light-hearted steps, I turned back towards the office. It was the moment my hand touched the doorknob.

Suddenly, from behind, I was pulled back with a tight embrace so strong it took my breath away.\
Startled, speechless, Yui-san gently pressed her lips to my ear.

"...Hey, Kanata. Is it okay to hope? That you'll fall for me again?"

Suddenly hearing such words — I couldn’t help but gasp. I could feel my heart pounding so loudly it was almost unbearable.

"This time, I absolutely won’t let you go… so be prepared."

A gentle kiss on my ear made me turn around in surprise. Then, seeing my flushed face, Yui-san smiled warmly.

　Until recently, she’d always seemed hesitant to touch me — perhaps I’d pressed a button that shouldn’t have been pushed.

That confident smile, reminiscent of our student days, shot straight through my heart with astonishing ease — leaving me utterly speechless.
