Episode 69: Didn't we make a promise?

----This aircraft will shortly be arriving at Naha Airport.

With that announcement, the aircraft tilted as if to make a sharp turn. Opening the closed aeroplane window just a little and looking down, I saw the emerald green sea and islands spreading out below.

"Yui-san, it's amazing, the colour of the sea is completely different!"

Completely forgetting that I was here for work today, I turned to look at Yui-san. She leaned towards me slightly to look out of the window and smiled gently, asking, "Is this your first time in Okinawa?"

Although I had lived in various prefectures all over Japan due to my father's job transfers, this was indeed my first time in Okinawa.\
　Had I attended a Japanese high school, perhaps I might have visited on a school trip... but unfortunately, I spent my three high school years living in England, so I wasn't very familiar with Japanese resort destinations.

Of course, I knew this company operated a flagship resort hotel in Okinawa, but I never dreamed the day would come when I'd actually visit it myself.

All of this was thanks to becoming Yui-san's secretary. I suppose this is what they mean by a perk of the job.\
The new branch opening soon will be the second one in Okinawa.

Starting today, we'll be staying for two nights at a competing hotel, and my job is to accompany Yui-san on her research.

After landing safely, I collected my heavy suitcase packed with clothes.\
I'd been told to come in casual wear, so everything inside was my own clothes. Today, I'm wearing the white dress I bought especially for this occasion.\
Just as she'd said, suits would definitely look out of place at a resort; the flight to Okinawa was packed with holidaymakers.\
Naturally, Yui-san isn't in a suit today either. She wore a camisole with a white shirt over it, and the single diamond necklace peeking out at her neckline sparkled faintly with each step.

"How many times have you been to Okinawa, Yui-san?"

I asked as I slid my suitcase across the smooth airport floor.

"Four or five times, I suppose. This is my first time since joining this company, so I've never been privately."

"I see. I thought Japanese high schools went there on school trips or something."

Ah, I suppose that's true. My high school went to Australia, though.

Australia, eh? Right, I'd completely forgotten that the school Yui-san attended was a posh one. So it wasn't domestic, but overseas. Makes sense.

If I ever got the chance to go overseas on business, I should be able to help a bit since I speak English. Unfortunately, it doesn't look like there'll be much opportunity for that today.

　I walk around, glancing around the airport.\
Even though I'm here for work, it's my first time in Okinawa, so I've thoroughly studied the guidebook – that's just between us.\
Yui-san is kind, so I was secretly hoping she might give me time to buy souvenirs before heading back.\
I'd planned to buy some red sweet potato tarts at the airport for everyone in the Budget Management Department, who must be busy because I'm away.

　And then, sea grapes, sōki soba, taco rice... I was even thinking, if I was lucky, maybe I could try some unique Okinawan gourmet food. If Yui found out about that, she'd probably be exasperated, telling me I wasn't here on holiday.\
But I was genuinely that excited about today's business trip.

　After picking up the pre-booked hire car at the airport, Yui-san effortlessly lifted my suitcase as if it were nothing and stowed it in the compact car's boot.

"I'm terribly sorry. This really should be my job, shouldn't it? And the driving too..."

It's generally considered wrong for the president to drive instead of the secretary. As I apologised, feeling truly remorseful, Yui-san turned to me with a look of surprise.

"Kanata, you have a licence?"

"Well, I do. I got it in my fourth year. It's just a paper licence though..."

I hadn't driven on the road once since graduating from driving school. I didn't even own a car; the licence had long since served only as identification.\
Yui laughed at my diminished state.

"Don't worry about that sort of thing. I'd feel uneasy having you drive. Just do as you normally would."

Saying that, Yui opened the passenger door as she always did. My shoulders relaxed a little, and I got in as prompted, saying, "Thank you."\
Yui got into the car a moment later, then started the engine. A lukewarm breeze blew out, followed a little later by the cool air conditioning hitting my cheek, which felt pleasant.

　From the car starting off gently, I stared intently out the window.

"Hey, Yui. The plants in Okinawa are completely different from Tokyo, aren't they?"

The trees sprouting up along the roadside, reaching skyward, felt quintessentially southern island. The sky, endlessly blue and clear, held enormous cumulonimbus clouds floating in it, looking different from Tokyo's skies.

"You'll be even more surprised when you see the sea. I think it'll be visible soon."

Just as Yui-san said, a little while later, the view that burst through the car window took my breath away.\
The shallow sea stretched endlessly in emerald green, and the white sandy beach sparkled as it reflected the sunlight.

"Wow, amazing... beautiful."

"The hotel we're staying at on the second day has a private beach right next to it, so look forward to that."

A private beach, huh. I'd like to walk on the sandy beach. I wonder what it feels like. My heart leapt with anticipation.\
The car carrying my excited self was heading towards the company's own hotel, which was about to open, just as Yui had explained on the plane.

　Stepping inside the gleaming, newly completed building, the entrance floor shone so smoothly it seemed it might reflect my face.\
There were ninety guest rooms in total. Remarkably, there were three different restaurants.\
There was also a lounge where you could enjoy drinks overlooking the sea, and apparently a night pool too.\
The range of affiliated activities was extensive, and paid 'Loyalty Members' could use the concierge service at no extra charge.\
　Truly befitting a high-end luxury resort. Even a single chair exuded an air of sophistication.

After a brief meeting with the manager, Yui and I toured the property, meticulously checking each guest room and facility for final confirmation.\
I diligently noted down every single point Yui pointed out in my notebook.\
I found myself completely captivated by the serious gaze of Yui in work mode, so different from her usual self.

The very first thing Yui-san did upon becoming president was to unify the membership system, which had previously been separate for each hotel brand.\
While the mechanism where membership grades rise based on usage frequency remains unchanged, this new membership system incorporates numerous benefits that members will appreciate. For instance, even members who primarily use business hotels or restaurants can, through repeated use, gain access to higher-end luxury brand hotels.\
　This membership scheme proved a resounding success, boosting business usage and steadily increasing the number of paid members eligible for premium services since its launch two years prior.

The acquisition of my former company's 'Web Production Division' likely stemmed from this very strategy. By focusing on operating the members-only site and developing applications to enhance member services, we have now, in our third year, shifted from the phase of 'increasing membership' to one of 'increasing repeat customers and boosting usage frequency'.

To this end, it seems that since last fiscal year, preparations for new openings and refurbishments of existing stores have commenced, continuing investment to prevent customer fatigue.

　For this new store opening, substantial borrowing from the parent company has funded equipment investment. Anticipating inbound demand, they've also hired several new employees proficient in foreign languages to provide services rivalling those of foreign-owned hotels.\
After repeated discussions, this represents a business decision that, in a sense, carries the company's fortunes – Yui-san's expression during the hotel inspection was serious.

"...Right then, we've seen enough. Shall we head to the hotel we're staying at tonight? You must be tired too, Kanata?"

After inspecting every corner, Yui stretched her body fully and said this.

"I'm not tired at all, I'm fine."

Watching you remain so focused the entire time, I didn't feel the slightest bit tired myself. Knowing all that effort was for me made my heart feel warm deep inside.

　It struck me anew just how remarkable Yui-san truly is. How much effort must she have put in all this time?\
Only now did I regret the four years we spent apart. Why on earth could I so easily let go of this person who cared for me so deeply?

If only I hadn't run away back then — I stopped myself before finishing that thought. Regretting the past serves no purpose.\
Now, you're beside me, and I'm beside you. That alone... is happiness enough.

After greeting the manager, we got into the car. The setting sun streamed through the window, illuminating Yui-san's profile. Yui-san really is beautiful, no matter how often I see her.

"Sorry for dragging you along. Must have been boring, wasn't it?"

As the car started moving, Yui-san said this apologetically. So I hurriedly shook my head.

"Not at all. Seeing you at work... you looked really cool."

My voice dropped just a little. This was the truth. Truly, you were impressive. Every time I saw that serious profile, my heart would pound so hard it felt like it would leap out.\
Then Yui-san smiled happily and glanced at me with just a quick look.

"Really? Could it be... you've fallen for me all over again?"

"Oh, come on. I'm trying to compliment you, why do you have to tease me like that straight away..."

Falling for you all over again? What nonsense. I've liked you ever since that time.\
　In fact, my feelings just keep growing. I'm falling for you more and more, without limit. ...But I'd never say something like that out loud.

I kept staring out the car window at the sea reflecting the sunset light as we headed back to the hotel.\
Starting today, I'd be sharing a room with Yui-san for the next two nights.\
When I stayed at her place before, I'd been drinking, so I wasn't particularly nervous. But now... I was feeling a little... fluttery.

　I steal a glance at her profile. Even though I'm so conscious of you, Yui-san seems completely unchanged. It feels like I'm the only one who likes you, and that made me feel a little resentful.

By the time we reached the hotel where we were staying, the sunset had completely faded and the surroundings had grown dim.\
After parking, pulling the handbrake, and unbuckling her seatbelt, Yui-san suddenly squeezed my hand tightly.\
　My already tense heart gave an extra, sharp thud.

"...From today, we can be together all the time, can't we?"

Her deep, dark eyes looked straight at me. Then, taking my hand, she gently pressed her lips to the back of it, as if cherishing it.\
I felt the warmth rush to my face at that soft sensation.

"Yui-san, aren't you working right now..."

"It's past six already. Work's finished."

Her long fingers slipped smoothly between mine, and her left hand clasped mine tightly. Why was it — there was a faint sense of unease about that left hand holding mine. Yet, unable to pinpoint the source of that unease, I returned Yui-san's gaze.

　Lately, Yui-san has been like she's gone back to her university days. You can just see it written all over her face that she's determined not to let me escape.

"...You did say we wouldn't do anything, right?"

Feeling uneasy, I double-checked just to be sure. Yui-san laughed heartily, saying, "I said we wouldn't do anything, didn't I?"

　Really? Yui-san is a liar, after all. Not that I'm expecting anything. But... actually, right now, I'm regretting booking a twin room just a little.

"Right then, shall we go? You must be tired today, so get some rest. We've got tomorrow too."

Stepping out of the car, a lukewarm breeze brushed against my bare skin. Then, holding hands with Yui-san, we headed towards the hotel.

"...What are your plans for tomorrow?"

I asked casually, dangling our joined hands. Since I'd been told I only needed to accompany her, I hadn't made any appointments anywhere besides meeting the manager of our own hotel. So I hadn't asked what Yui-san intended to do tomorrow.\
Staying at a competitor's hotel was the purpose, so I'd thought she might just stay there all day.

　Yui smiled brightly, peering up at me.

"Tomorrow... we're inspecting a partner facility. It's a place you'll adore, Kanata."

"Eh...?"

I stopped in my tracks, returning her gaze. A gentle breeze softly ruffled Yui's silky black hair.

　A place I adore. Only one comes to mind. In Okinawa, one of the most famous spots. Where the whale sharks are. It was in the guidebook too. A double-page spread, the photo of the huge tank flooding back into my mind.

If I'm going all the way to Okinawa, I'd love to go. I'd been desperately trying to suppress that urge to beg for it. It's a work trip, so it's not allowed. I mustn't be selfish.

"Yui... Are you sure? Are you really sure?"

"I promised, didn't I? That I'd take you to the aquarium. Sorry it took so long."

Staring intently into my wavering eyes, Yui smiled — with extraordinary tenderness.
