Episode 68: That depends on Kanata, though

"Right then, to celebrate Aosawa-san becoming a secretary... Cheers!"

Manager Yamazato's toast was met with the satisfying clink of glasses colliding in unison, echoing through the private room of the izakaya.\
As of today, I leave the Budget Management Department. Next week, I restart my working life as a secretary to the president.\
Today, the Budget Management Department alone held a farewell party for me.

　I'm so glad I joined Yui-san's company and was assigned to this department. Though it was a short time, it truly felt like home.\
No replacement has been decided yet for the role I'm leaving behind. While I wasn't handling too many duties due to being in training, I'll likely cause some trouble for everyone for a while.\
Even so, I'm truly grateful that both Mitsuya-san and Seno-san supported me without a single frown.

"It's wonderful news, but I'll miss you, Aosawa-chan~"

Mitsuya-san said wistfully, beer mug in hand. We'd known each other since we were fresh out of university. It was sad, but fortunately, the Budget Management Department and the President's Office were on the same floor, so we wouldn't completely lose touch.

　Then, Seno-san, seated next to Mitsuya-san, deftly removed some yakitori from its skewer and murmured.

"Still, it's truly impressive, isn't it? How on earth did you persuade the president? Does Aosawa-san seem quiet but turn out to be surprisingly aggressive?"

Hearing that, I shook my head in disbelief.

　If 'aggressive' means being proactive in romance, then I'm not that. If anything, I feel like I'm at the opposite end of the spectrum.

Even with Yui, I'd always been the one being pushed. It's not that I'd never made proactive advances... but that was only possible because alcohol had made me stupid. It's not my true nature. Probably.

"I just followed your advice, Seno-san, and kept going to the president's office to convey my enthusiasm..."

Sorry, that's a lie. The truth is, I threatened Yui-san and practically forced a YES out of her. But I couldn't possibly say that, so I tried to gloss over it. The part about conveying my enthusiasm wasn't wrong, though.

Hearing my answer, Seno-san grinned.

"Hmm, I see. But I must say, I'm rather envious. Perhaps you have a knack for attracting wealthy people, Aosawa-san? After all, the person you fancy is rich too, isn't he? Or is he already your boyfriend?"

Hearing that said so casually, I couldn't help but let out a small "Eh?" in surprise. Oh dear, reacting like that practically confirmed he was wealthy.

"Well, well, so Aosawa-san's boyfriend is rich. How lovely."

Manager Yamazato said this while stuffing her face with fried chicken, seemingly not giving it a second thought.

"No, um, we're not actually dating. I just like him..."

"You're not dating? But seriously, those earrings you always wear – they're definitely a gift, right?"

"Getting such an expensive present but not actually dating? Could he be married, by any chance? No, no, no, you mustn't. An affair? That's just wrong. Aosawa-san's so lovely, it'd be such a waste. Even if he's rich, you won't find happiness that way. You really ought to stop."

"Seno-san, come on, that's not possible, is it?"

Yui-san was engaged, but not married. Therefore, it wasn't yet an "affair". Absolutely not.\
　But what to do? If she said anything more, she felt she'd dig herself into a hole. She absolutely couldn't let the other person realise it was Yui-san, so she forced a wry smile and fell silent. Then Mitsuya-san, sitting next to her, gave Seno-san's ear a sharp pinch.

"Listen, don't bully Aosawa-chan too much, okay?"

"Mitsuya-san, that hurts!"

"And this earring of yours? It's a present from someone, isn't it?"

"No, I bought this myself."

Seno-san is popular, so it's quite plausible. Mitsuya-san skilfully diverted the topic, and I breathed a sigh of relief.\
Seno-san had even said she'd "given up" on Yui-san. If women were also potential romantic partners for her, she might realise the nature of my relationship with Yui-san. Honestly, I couldn't tell if that remark was serious or a joke.

"You two really have become such good friends, haven't you?"

Manager Yamazato said this with a warm smile, watching the pair continue their lively chatter.

"...Um, I've been meaning to ask, but what exactly makes those two seem like they're such good friends?"

Wondering about it, I quietly whispered to Manager Yamazato to ask.

"You know, Seno-san used to be so quiet before. Mitsuya-san's such a straightforward, cheerful girl too, so perhaps they just click. You know how they say 'they fight like...'?"

Ah, I see. To Manager Yamazato, who knew Seno-san before we joined this department, that's how the two of them appear.\
　I’d assumed they were constantly bickering and didn’t get along, but perhaps this is just how they are.\
Thinking this, I began sipping my lemon sour. Even after leaving the Budget Management Department, I hoped we could still occasionally come out for drinks like this. That thought crossed my mind.

"Thank you for today."

After leaving the izakaya, I bowed deeply to Manager Yamazato, who had stepped out ahead to wait. If it weren't for her, I never would have become Yui-san's secretary.

"Aosawa-san, do your best. I'm rooting for you."

With that, Manager Yamazato gave my shoulder a light pat. So I looked firmly back into her eyes and nodded.\
I wouldn't dream of letting her down. I absolutely will prove myself useful. I vowed silently.

"Hey, stop leaning on me! Walk straight. You're heavy!"

Suddenly, Mitsuya-san's disgruntled voice came from behind, making me turn around. Supporting the utterly wasted Seno-san, the two of them staggered out of the shop.\
It was definitely Mitsuya-san's fault Seno-san ended up wasted. The cause was starting a drinking contest partway through – what were they thinking?

"Right then, Mitsuya-san, you take responsibility and see Seno-san home, alright? Well, that's all from me! My husband's here to pick me up, so I'll be off now. Everyone, see you back at the office."

Manager Yamazato announced this matter-of-factly and left. Left behind, Mitsuya-san looked dazed for a moment before glancing briefly at me.\
　I frantically shook my head from side to side. No way, no way, no way – Seno-san and I were heading in opposite directions.

"Seno-san, come on, you can make it home on your own, right? You can stand and walk yourself."

She grabbed her shoulders and shook her, but her body just wobbled limply. Even she realised then, ah, there's no way she can make it home alone.

"Oh, for goodness' sake, Kaori, you're so annoying."

I was startled when Seno-san suddenly called out Mitsuya-san's first name. The hand that had been firmly shaking Seno-san's shoulder stopped abruptly.

"Um, Mitsuya-san. Seno-san probably can't make it home alone..."

"Ah, ahaha, you're right. Got it, leave it to me. Take care getting home, Aosawa-chan."

"Yes, thank you."

"Eh? Aosawa-san, you're leaving already? Oh, that's a shame. Hey, let's go to one more place, Kao... mmmph!"

Mitsuya-san covered Seno-san's mouth with her palm to silence her. Her bloodshot eyes peered intently at Seno-san's face.

"Be quiet. Please, don't say another word. You're far too drunk."

Pushing Seno-san back as she mumbled complaints, Mitsuya-san gave a wry smile and turned back to me. While holding her up, I felt as if her eyes alone were telling me to hurry home. I nodded and waved goodbye to them both.

But, whatever she says, Mitsuya-san is actually quite considerate, so I don't think Seno-san needs worrying about. Perhaps, as Manager Yamazato said, they really do get along well. Thinking that, I headed towards the station.

On the way, my pocket vibrated. Seeing the name on my phone made me smile naturally.

—Did you get home alright? Didn't drink too much?

It was a message from Yui-san. I'd told her about the farewell party last night on the phone.\
　Yui-san was terribly worried about my low tolerance, even saying, "I'm worried, so I'll come pick you up." Of course, I declined. After all, it would be terrible if she saw me like that.

――I'm heading home now. I didn't drink much today.

I stopped and replied to the message. It made me incredibly happy that she worried like this. It was strange, but whenever I drank, I invariably wanted to see Yui-san.\
　I want to throw myself into her arms. I want nothing more than to be utterly spoiled by her.

"I wish we could go back to the same house again..."

Voicing this impossible wish, my steps home to the house without Yui-san felt heavy. On days like this, I'll sleep hugging Shachi-kun. Along with the scent of Yui-san's favourite perfume.

＊＊＊

The following week. As instructed by Yui-san's message to "wait in the president's office," I headed there first thing in the morning. In one corner of the president's office, my desk and laptop had been set up.\
Running my fingertips gently over the gleaming surface of the desk, the reality of it all gradually sank in.

A little later, the door to the president's office opened. Spotting me, Yui-san gave me a warm smile.

"Good morning, Yui-san."

"Mm, good morning."

"Thank you for the desk. You arranged it for me, didn't you?"

"Mm. Let's get started today, shall we?"

"Yes, I'll do my best. So I can be of use to you, Yui-san."

After placing her bag on the desk, Yui-san turned back to me and said, "Right then, let's put you to work straight away," so I hurriedly pulled a notebook and ballpoint pen from my bag.

　But Yui-san just smiled at me.

"You don't need a notebook or pen."

Saying that, Yui-san took my hand holding the pen. She stood slightly taller than me. That sweet scent I adored, and her slender yet soft body.\
Hugging me tightly from the front, I was startled and my eyes widened.

"Ah, um... Yui-san? What are you doing...?"

"Hugging you."

"Wh-why?"

"A good morning hug."

"Er, ah, did you lock the door? What if someone sees us..."

"No one's coming. It's fine."

My heart began to pound steadily. What should I do? I desperately wanted to hug her back. Would it be alright to? While I hesitated, her arms reluctantly but gently released me.\
　Her eyes looked down at me with such tenderness that my chest tightened painfully.

"Thanks. Thanks to you, Kanata, I think I can get through today."

"What's that supposed to mean... Yui-san, you're always teasing me about this sort of thing."

Seeing me flustered, she seemed to be enjoying it. Pouting my lips as I said that, Yui-san laughed.

"Right then, to the point. I've got a favour to ask, alright? I need you to accompany me on a business trip next month. Kanata, is that alright for you? I need you to sort the flight tickets and hotel arrangements."

The word "business trip" immediately made me sit up straight. It's fine. I haven't booked a single day next month, just in case anything comes up.

"Yes, that's fine. Where are we going?"

She opened her notebook and clicked her ballpoint pen.

"Okinawa."

"Eh, Okinawa...?"

Startled, I blurted out the question without thinking.

"The new branch opens next month, right? It's for that inspection. And since we're there, I thought we might as well try staying at some of the competitors. I've picked out a few places, so I'll share the schedule and list with you later."

"Y-yes, understood."

My heart pounding, I jotted down the note in my notebook. Then Yui-san peered over at my face.

"And... it's fine if we share a room, right?"

I looked up from my notebook, startled. Yui-san smiled brightly and added, "A double room is fine."

"Yui-san, what are you saying...!? Surely you're joking?"

"I'm dead serious."

I stared back into Yui-san's smiling eyes, but couldn't fathom what she was thinking. Somehow, it felt like the old Yui had returned.

"...Yui-san, you're naughty."

"It's alright, I won't do anything."

"Really...?"

Yui-san saying she won't do anything is absolutely unreliable. When I said it doubtfully, Yui-san replied, "Well, that depends on you, Kanata," and laughed.

"The hotel... we'll get a twin room, alright?"

"What a shame. But are you sure you want to share a room?"

"...If you keep being so mean, I'll book two singles."

"Sorry, sorry, don't sulk. Let's share a room since we're there. Come on?"

Glaring at Yui-san as she squeezed my hand tightly, trying to appease my sulking pout, I nodded.

　Little did I know then that this first business trip of my life, to Okinawa no less, would create memories I'd never forget.
