Episode 64: Come to the President's Office Immediately

After lunch break, I returned to my desk. Manager Yamazato must have just come back too, as she was tucking her lunchbox, wrapped in a pretty floral-patterned cloth, into her tote bag.

Talking with Yukiyasu-san helped me sort out my feelings.

My desire to become Yui-san's secretary. My hesitation vanished, and that feeling became unwavering.

　Though it felt awkward to bring it up while still in training... nothing would progress unless I consulted Manager Yamazato. After all, I needed my supervisor's recommendation to apply.

My heart was pounding, and I could feel sweat beading on my palms.

I'd only just joined the company; it might be too soon to ask to be a secretary. If she said I wasn't ready yet, that would be that... but unless I asked, I'd never know what she'd say.

　Pushing myself forward, I approached Manager Yamazato's desk.

"Manager Yamazato. I'm back now."

"Ah, Aosawa-san, welcome back. Did you manage to relax a little?"

Manager Yamazato said this and smiled at me. The tension in my chest eased just a little. Even if I asked to apply for the secretary position, Manager Yamazato surely wouldn't reject me outright. She would listen to me.

　If I conveyed my enthusiasm, perhaps, just perhaps, it might happen. Though we'd only worked together for a few months, I felt I'd come to understand what kind of person Manager Yamazato was.

"Thank you for your consideration. And, well, there's something I'd like to discuss..."

As soon as I said that, Manager Yamazato, as if waiting for it, lifted the corners of her mouth in a gentle smile. Then, before I could continue, she said, "Shall we change location?"

　The break room for the second time today. Told to sit on an empty sofa and wait, I suppressed my restlessness and settled onto the plush red sofa as instructed. A moment later, Manager Yamazato returned, holding two iced coffees.

"Here you go. Aosawa-san's."

"Thank you. Ah, the money..."

"It's fine. It's only ten yen, after all."

Saying that, Manager Yamazato smiled. Sitting close enough that our shoulders might touch, she exuded the sweet scent of a mature woman.

"Right then, shall we get straight to the point? What is it you wish to discuss?"

Manager Yamazato looked at me with her usual gentle smile, showing not the slightest flicker of surprise at my sudden request to talk... I even got the feeling she somehow already knew what I was about to say.

I'd always thought her a bit of a scatterbrain, but she also had this uncanny ability to read situations... I couldn't help but think, 'She really is a manager through and through.'

　Taking a deep breath to steady myself, I steeled my resolve and spoke.

"I've been thinking about this morning's announcement about the secretary position... I'd like to apply. I realise it's presumptuous of me to suggest this while still in training... but I really want to give it a shot."

　I clenched my sweaty palms tightly and looked intently at Manager Yamazato. I desperately wanted to convey that this wasn't some half-hearted whim.\
Manager Yamazato stared at me intently, then suddenly softened her expression and smiled.

"...Aosawa-san, do you remember what you said to me on the day you were assigned here?"

"Eh?"

Suddenly asked that, a question mark appeared above my head.\
The first time I spoke to Manager Yamazato? What did I say? Did I say something rude? Trying to recall it instantly, my eyes darted around, and Manager Yamazato laughed and said.

"I remember. Because I was really surprised. You see, Aosawa-san, you said, 'Could I see the financial statements for the past three fiscal years and the medium-term business plan?' It was the first time I'd ever had a new recruit ask me that."

Had I... said that? No, I might have. After all, right after joining the company, I was desperate to understand what Yui-san was trying to achieve here.

"After that, you studied hard and asked so many questions, didn't you? You were genuinely trying to grasp the company's management philosophy. People like that are surprisingly rare. So, to be honest, I'd always thought... maybe this one isn't interested in budget management, but more in strategic planning or that sort of thing."

Hearing that, I remembered. I'm pretty sure, right after joining, I must have bombarded Manager Yamazato with questions relentlessly.

"...I'm sorry. I must have been a terribly troublesome subordinate."

Looking back, it's all rather embarrassing. I was desperate to be of help to Yui-san myself...\
Looking rather crestfallen as I said this, Manager Yamazato chuckled softly and shook her head.

"Not at all. Before I became a manager in the Budget Management Department, I spent a long time in the Corporate Planning Department myself. It was enjoyable being able to discuss all sorts of things. I've gone off track, but... what I'm trying to say is, I'm really delighted that you, Aosawa-san, have volunteered to take on this challenge. That's my honest feeling. Opportunities to learn alongside the president don't come along often. I think it suits you perfectly. So, I'm delighted to recommend you."

Hearing her say that with a smile, I couldn't help but lift my face in surprise at the joy.

"Thank you. Are you sure? I'm still in training."

"That doesn't matter. Opportunities don't always come along when you feel ready. If a chance arises, you should seize it. That's incredibly important. After all, you never know when the next opportunity might come along – wouldn't it be a waste to just wait? Even if it doesn't work out, you'll always have a place to return to. It's worth the challenge. I'll be rooting for you."

　Ah, I truly felt grateful from the bottom of my heart that this person was my manager. Manager Yamazato, I'm sorry for ever thinking you were a bit of a scatterbrain. Since becoming a working adult and interacting with so many mature individuals like this, I've come to realise it anew.

I'm still so immature and green. I couldn't do anything on my own; I'm here only because of the support of so many people.\
Yui-san, she leapt over every step of the ladder that newcomers are supposed to climb one by one through effort, and became president. How much hardship must that have entailed?

　Thank you, I bowed deeply once more. Manager Yamazato smiled and said, "I'm recommending you, so you absolutely must pass." So I smiled and nodded back.

＊＊＊

Upon returning from the overnight training session, I immediately informed Mitsuya-san and Seno-san that I would be applying for the open recruitment. If I passed the document screening, there would be an interview too. I saw no need to keep it secret, and I knew it would inevitably cause them some inconvenience.

Mitsuya-san firmly grasped my hand and said, "I'll be rooting for you." Seno-san, in her usual manner, offered a single, straightforward word of encouragement: "Do your best."

And so, I succeeded in securing the cooperation of the Budget Management Section. Yet, I deliberately said nothing to Yui about applying for the secretary position. Even in our daily messages, I haven't touched upon this subject at all.\
　Because, for some reason, Yui-san doesn't really like talking about work when she's with me. I wondered if she might be the type who likes to keep work and private life separate.

Just as she'd said in spring, "Summer gets busy," perhaps because the grand opening of the new large resort hotel was imminent, Yui-san was either constantly away on business trips or, even when present, would vanish into the president's office without taking a break, a convenience store bag in hand. That was her daily routine.

　If I could become her secretary, could I support Yui-san like that? No, I mustn't get weak-hearted wondering if I could. I will become one, absolutely. I need that level of determination; otherwise, there's no way a newbie like me could push aside the other candidates and become her secretary.

　Manager Yamazato is truly efficient; she drafted my recommendation letter almost immediately afterwards. Despite being busy with her reduced hours, she carefully reviewed and edited even the motivation statement I’d written myself. I’m truly indebted to her.

She’s kind, considerate, and though she seems gentle, she observes people keenly. A wonderful person. Someday, I want to be like Manager Yamazato. That’s what I thought.

　Thanks largely to Manager Yamazato's guidance, my application documents were safely completed three days before the deadline. I'd checked thoroughly for typos and mistakes, and I felt I'd polished the content until it was solid.

When it comes to sheer determination, I absolutely won't be beaten by anyone. Thinking that, I clicked the submit button on the application form.

"Right, submitted... done."

After confirming it uploaded successfully, I let out a sigh and slumped back into my chair. That was the first hurdle cleared. Apparently there's a document screening next, but would Yui-san look over my application?\
I was a little curious how she'd react to my applying. Would she tell me the approximate competition rate if I asked?

I moistened my lips with the tea, now thoroughly cold. I'd been so engrossed that quite some time had passed since brewing it.\
Perhaps I should send Yui-san a message tonight after all. As I idly pondered this, a pop-up from the company chat suddenly appeared with a plop in the bottom right corner of my monitor. I couldn't help but double-take at the familiar name displayed there.

"Hmm...?"

'Come to the president's office immediately.'

The display name read 'Ichinose Yui'. There's no one else in this company with that exact name. This was unmistakably a message addressed to me from Yui-san, the company president.

This was the first time I'd ever received an internal chat message. Usually, if she needed something, she'd message my personal mobile. Being summoned to the president's office was also a first. So this couldn't be personal. It was definitely work-related.

Somehow... this gave me a bad feeling.

"Ah, um, Manager Yamazato?"

"Hmm? What is it? Couldn't you post it?"

I timidly addressed Manager Yamazato, seated at the birthday seat in our Budget Management Department.

"No. I managed to post it... but I've just been summoned by the president. Would it be alright if I stepped away for a moment...?"

As soon as I said that, Mitsuya-san and Seno-san stood up from their chairs in unison with a clatter, then hurriedly leaned in to peer at my monitor as if trying to read it. Seeing the president's chat message still displayed, Seno-san tilted his head.

"Blimey... which one is it, I wonder?"

"Which one? Eh? What do you mean?"

Mitsuya-san followed up, asking Seno-san to clarify his words.

"If the president is calling you out, it must be serious, right? I mean, we can't tell if it's favourable or not."

Hearing that, I suddenly felt a bit uneasy. Knowing Yui-san, I don't think she'd be angry... but I still felt a little worried.\
　Manager Yamazato gave my restless shoulders a light pat.

"Now, now, you two, stop stirring up anxiety. You won't know about the president until you ask the president. Anyway, Aosawa-san, go on then."

Hearing that, I nodded.

"Sorry, I'll be off then."

Grabbing my notebook and ballpoint pen, I hurried towards the president's office where Yui-san waited, the two seniors' encouragement behind me.

Standing before that imposing door I'd never entered before, my heart pounded so hard it felt like it might burst any moment.

I knocked timidly, and from inside came Yui-san's voice: "Come in."
