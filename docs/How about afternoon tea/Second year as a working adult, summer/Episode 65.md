Episode 65: Please Stop With Those Jokes, They're Bad For The Heart

I placed my hand on the cool, golden door handle. For some reason, at a time like this, I found myself recalling the first time I met Yui-san.

　Never before or since have I felt as nervous as I did meeting Yui-san for the first time at the airport. The tension I feel now resembles that sensation back then – a mixture of anticipation and unease.

Pushing open the heavy door, I found myself locked eye to eye with Yui-san. She sat in her leather desk chair, propping her cheek on her hand, staring at me.

"Excuse me..."

It was my first time in the president's office. Intrigued by the novelty, I instinctively scanned the room. It was considerably larger than I'd imagined.\
Yui-san's desk, bookshelves lining the walls. And what appeared to be a reception sofa – a huge black leather one, easily big enough for someone to lie down on comfortably.

The person before me was someone I knew well, yet within this room, she seemed almost like someone from another world.

"Lock the door. You can sit there."

Eh, lock... the door? Suppressing the urge to ask why, I turned the key behind my back while watching Yui-san's expression. Click. The cold sound of the lock echoed.

　Though told I could sit on the sofa, I didn't move towards it. Instead, I stared intently into her eyes. Noticing my anxious, wavering gaze, Yui-san suddenly smiled gently.

"...Don't be so scared. I won't attack you, I promise. I just want to talk without anyone interrupting us."

　Yui rose from her desk and walked towards the sofa. After sitting down, she patted the space beside her, beckoning me over.

I'd been slightly afraid she might be angry about me applying without consulting her first, but the person sitting there was the usual Yui. I felt relieved, and the tension in my body seemed to ease a little.

"...You called me over so suddenly, it startled me."

　I cautiously approached the sofa and sat down, leaving just a fist's width of space beside her. My body sank into the luxurious leather upholstery as if being drawn in.

Then Yui turned her whole body towards me, propped her elbows on the backrest, and looked straight at me.

"I'm the one who was surprised. Why did you apply for the secretary position? You never said a word about it."

Application documents — you've already looked at them, even though I only just submitted them. I'd imagined the HR department might sift through them during the initial screening, but judging by this, that doesn't seem to be the case.

"...But the application guidelines said it was open to anyone regardless of company history, age, or department. So does that mean I'm not allowed to apply?"

When I asked back, sounding a bit put out, Yui-san hedged, "Well, that's... because I hadn't anticipated Kanata applying."

"...Did you actually look through my application? I worked really hard on it..."

"Yes... I did. I read your motivation letter and your recommendation. It made me really happy to see how much you want to work hard for the company."

I looked into Yui-san's dark eyes as she squeezed my hand tightly and said that.

This habit of squeezing my hand tightly when she wants to talk seriously hasn't changed since our student days.

"It's not for the company. I want to be of help to you, Yui-san."

Yes, it wasn't for the company. But truthfully, it wasn't just for Yui-san either. I simply didn't want anyone else to take the place beside the Yui-san I loved so much.\
Yui-san's eyes widened slightly in surprise, then she let out a deep sigh.

"Kanata... that's cheating."

Being called cheating, against my will, wasn't amusing. I haven't been sneaky at all. After all, I didn't tell Yui-san I was applying in the first place, and I certainly didn't sneak in behind her back.

If anyone's breaking the rules, it's Yui-san. Because right now, she's the one who called me to the president's office.

"I applied properly, following the rules, didn't I?"

"Yes, you did... but still, it's no good. Please withdraw your application."

"Why?"

"Because it defeats the purpose. If Kanata gets busy too, there's no point in having a secretary."

Defeats the purpose? What? What does that mean?

Not understanding the meaning of the words, I peered into her composed face, trying to discern her true intent.

The distance between us closed slightly, and naturally, my heart began to pound faster.

After all — I don't want to. I don't want to give her up to anyone else.\
Yui-san is truly an enchanting person. …If I were to become her secretary and spend long hours together, I think it would be impossible not to fall for her.\
Even though she doesn't chase women like she used to, this woman is, at her core, a born womaniser who woos women as naturally as breathing.

I gaze into her troubled, wavering eyes.\
　You have absolutely no idea how hopelessly I'm in love with you, Yui-san—so much so that I don't want to give even a single one of those smiles to anyone else.

"...I really, truly want to be your secretary, Yui-san. Please tell me the real reason. Am I not good enough?"

"I didn't say that."

Is that really true? It's possible you're just making up some excuse to hire someone more qualified.

"I'm no expert in management, but... I can understand the basics if I look at financial statements. If necessary, I'll study much, much harder. Even so... is it still no good?"

This time, it was my turn to squeeze Yui-san's hand back tightly. I certainly didn't apply on a whim.\
　I learnt the fundamentals of working life from Mitsuya-san at my previous company, and Manager Yamazato guided me through every detail – this company's management policies, competitor trends, and our own strengths.

Of course, I know I have shortcomings. But I'll make up for my lack of experience through sheer effort.\
Perhaps finally realising how serious I was, Yui-san lowered her eyebrows in a troubled expression.

"...I understand perfectly well that you're considering this seriously, Kanata. But... it means you'll have to align yourself with my schedule from now on, won't it? Your days off will become irregular, and business trips will increase."

"That's fine."

Hearing that, Yui crossed her arms and fell into deep thought, humming thoughtfully.\
　Could she be just a breath away from agreeing? Seizing the moment, I grabbed her left hand firmly with both of mine and tugged.

"Hey, Yui-san, please. I mean, if I become your secretary... we could spend more time together, couldn't we?"

"Eh?" Yui-san faltered. She blinked rapidly, her long lashes fluttering, then shook her head slightly from side to side, as if shaking something off.

"No, no, no... I can't. That's cheating, you know. You know I'm weak to your pleading, don't you? ...There are still three days until the deadline, so please, reconsider."

Reconsider what? My mind is made up. You don't need to be so reluctant. I frowned and glared at Yui-san.

"No. I won't withdraw it. ...If you dislike me that much, just reject me at the document screening stage, won't you?"

Upon hearing this, Yui let out a small sigh.

"...With Manager Yamazato's recommendation too, I couldn't possibly reject you out of personal feelings. Your application documents were perfect. Head and shoulders above the rest. There's literally no reason to reject you."

"Right? I mean, Manager Yamazato revised them for me multiple times. You might know this too, but Manager Yamazato is truly amazing. She's competent, kind, a reliable boss... she's my idol."

"...Hmm... Is that so..."

Yui's left hand, which was clasped with mine, tightened suddenly. Huh? Feeling something off, I looked up. Yui peered at my face and smiled brightly.

"You seem... rather fond of her, aren't you?"

That smile felt strangely familiar. I'd finally started to realise recently. When Yui acts like this, it actually means she's incredibly jealous.

"...Of course, I respect her. And lately, whenever I'm with Manager Yamazato, my heart races like crazy. I wonder why. At this rate, I might end up falling for her."

That was a lie, of course. I've never felt this way about anyone but Yui-san. But at this point, I couldn't care less about appearances.

"Eh... What are you saying? Yamazato-san is married, isn't she? That's not right, absolutely not. Because that's... adultery!"

I kept quiet about how Yui-san herself, back in her student days, used to play around with one girl after another despite having an engagement.

"Ah, that's none of your concern, Yui-san. My apologies. Anyway, I won't withdraw my application. You're the one who should reconsider."

Having said that, she released the hand she'd been clutching tightly and stood up.

"Right then, I'll get back to work."

"Ah, wait... we still need to talk...!"

You're just going to say to withdraw it anyway, aren't you? I'm not listening to that sort of talk anymore. I turned the inner lock with a click, hooked my hand on the door handle, and was about to leave the room when a hand reached out from behind and slammed the door shut.

"...Kanata, surely this is a joke?"

The voice from behind was weaker than I'd imagined, making me turn around reflexively. Startled by how close she was, I looked up and locked eyes with Yui-san, who hung her head dejectedly like a scolded puppy.

"You haven't fallen for Yamazato-san, have you...?"

Her eyes flickered with such palpable anxiety that, quite unexpectedly, my heart gave a sharp twinge.\
I couldn't help but chuckle softly, and Yui-san looked down at me, her eyes wide with bewilderment.

How strange. It should be obvious if you just think about it. Manager Yamazato isn't just married, she has children. And anyway, from the very beginning, I've only ever had eyes for you.

"...Yui-san, you're adorable."

"...Did you just tease me?"

Unaware of my thoughts, Yui-san's pouting face was so endearing I couldn't help but laugh out loud this time.

"Sometimes even I feel like getting my own back."

"Oh, come on... Jokes like that are bad for the heart, stop it..."

　Saying that, Yui-san pulled me close by my shoulder. Just as I thought, 'Huh?', she hugged me tight, and I found myself completely enveloped in her arms.

Instantly, my heart began pounding like it was about to burst.

Eh? Eh? What's going on? What on earth is happening?

"Ah, um, Yui-san...?"

　Even when I called her name, Yui-san didn't respond. She held me so tightly I feared I might suffocate, making me want to hug her back instinctively.

"...What... what's wrong, all of a sudden...?"

I wanted to see her face. It was the very moment I thought that when her lips gently pressed against my ear. My body, still held in her embrace, shuddered dramatically.

"...If you keep being so mean, I might just do something about it, you know."

Hearing her whisper that sweetly in my ear sent a shiver down my spine. I couldn't help it – I squeezed my eyes shut.

"Yui-san, y-it tickles...!"

Ever since we met again, she hardly ever tried to touch me, so why does she suddenly switch on like this at times like this? This girl.

She lightly bit my ear, and I almost let out a strange sound, so I instinctively pushed her shoulder hard.

"Yu, Yui-san, for goodness' sake...!"

Then, with surprising ease, distance opened up between us — and the eyes looking up at me narrowed mischievously.\
I knew immediately from those eyes that I was being teased.

"Your face is all red. Honestly, Kanata, you're so cute."

Saying that, Yui-san smiled brightly.\
Ever since we met again, Yui-san had been so demure, so I'd been getting carried away... but teasing Yui-san like that was probably still a bit too soon for me.

"...Doing this at work... Yui-san, you're such a naughty girl."

Hiding my flushed face with my arm, I protested like that. Yui-san laughed innocently, like a child who'd successfully pulled off a prank.

"Seeing cute Kanata like that means I can keep going this afternoon."

"Honestly, you're always saying things like that... I don't even know you anymore, Yui-san!"

Saying that, I hooked my hand on the doorknob this time, trying to hide my crimson face, and bolted out of the president's office as if fleeing.

Despite my desire to become a secretary, it seemed Yui-san had other ideas... But.\
I don't care about that. I'll overturn it no matter what.

　I stopped, crossed my arms, and pondered. Hmm. Was there some plan? Before Yui-san found another candidate.

Worrying alone wouldn't help. At times like this, it was best to seek others' opinions.\
Reaching that conclusion, I hurried back to my desk.
