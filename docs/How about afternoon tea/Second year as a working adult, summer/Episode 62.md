Episode 62: Because You Were Dating Back In Our Student Days, Weren't You?

The leaves on the avenue trees began to gleam a vibrant green, while large cumulonimbus clouds floated across the cobalt blue sky visible between the skyscrapers.

At last, the long-awaited summer had arrived once more.

Though the office was only a few minutes' walk from the nearest station, the air at this time of year, thick with that uniquely summery humidity that clings to your skin, meant even the commute left you sweating.

　Stepping through the automatic doors, the cool breeze caressing my cheeks felt refreshing.\
Right then, let's get to work today. After swiping my employee pass at the security gate in the entrance, I headed for the lift.

"Good morning, Manager Yamazato."

"Good morning, Aosawa-san."\
Only Manager Yamazato was at the Budget Management Department desk today. Come to think of it, Mitsuya-san and Seno-san both mentioned they were off on a two-day, one-night training course.

Apparently, because they're in the same department, they ended up having to share a room. I remember it distinctly because Mitsuya-san complained, "I hate sharing a room with Seno-san!"\
It turned into a tit-for-tat argument, with Seno-san also making a fuss, saying things like, "I can't possibly share a room with a smoker!"

　I was secretly worried about those two, who were like cats and dogs, having no buffer between them. But Manager Yamazato, watching them bicker as usual, tilted her head in puzzlement and said, "When did you two become so close?"

I couldn't see how they looked close at all, and it made me wonder if Manager Yamazato was perhaps incredibly naive.

　Recalling that as I sat down at my desk, I promptly booted up my PC. My routine after arriving at work was fixed.\
First thing in the morning, I'd launch the intranet and check the bulletin board. Manager Yamazato had instructed me right after my assignment: "Make sure to check it daily. Important company information is always uploaded there."

　So today, as always, I clicked on the bulletin board. Then, one of the latest posts displayed caught my eye, and my hand holding the mouse froze.

"Open recruitment...?"

The words "Notice of Internal Recruitment (President's Secretary)" displayed right next to the red NEW icon. I hovered the cursor over it and clicked.

At the end of spring, Yui-san had indeed stated she intended to hire a secretary from summer onwards. But — I had assumed she already had someone specific in mind for the role. I never imagined she would open it up to public recruitment.

　The notice uploaded outlined the circumstances leading to the recruitment of a president's secretary and the application requirements.\
It stated that regardless of company tenure, age, or department, applicants should prepare one A4 sheet containing a recommendation letter from their direct supervisor and their personal statement of motivation, then apply via the application form.\
The application period was a mere two weeks. The selection process would take one month. Following document screening, individual interviews would be conducted with shortlisted candidates to select one person. Simply put, that was what it said.

　The room should have been air-conditioned, yet the palm gripping the mouse grew clammy with sweat. I could feel my heartbeat steadily quickening.

To be perfectly honest, I thought this might be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. After all, I'd always wanted to support Yui-san.

But unfortunately, I was still relatively new to the company, currently in the thick of my OJT training period.\
　The application required a recommendation from my direct supervisor. I couldn't decide on my own. I wasn't even fully competent yet... There was no way I could do it.

While I was brooding over this, staring at the notice, a voice called "Aosawa-san" from behind and simultaneously tapped my shoulder. Startled, I let out a small yelp.

"Hyah!"

Turning around in a panic, I found Manager Yamazato standing behind me. Seeing my startled expression, she smiled faintly.

"I've been calling your name for ages."

"S-sorry, I didn't notice."

"No, no, it's alright. I just wanted to ask you about something... Were you looking at that? It must have been quite a shock. I've been with this company over ten years, but this is the first time we've ever had an open recruitment drive."

Saying this, Manager Yamazato bent down to peer at my monitor.

"I wonder what sort of people will apply..."

How nice. If only I'd joined two years earlier—no, even one year earlier — I might have had a future as Yui-san's secretary.

"...Aosawa-san, are you perhaps a little interested?"

"Eh?"

Caught out, I jerked upright. I was still learning the ropes here – how could I possibly say I was interested in another job? That would be utterly presumptuous.

"No, not at all. I was just looking..."

I hastily shook my head from side to side and closed the window. Manager Yamazato then said, "Is that so?" while lifting the corners of her mouth in a meaningful smile.\
Somehow, I felt like she'd seen right through me. I'd always thought Manager Yamazato was a bit of a scatterbrain, but perhaps she has a surprisingly sharp side too...

To be perfectly honest, I couldn't get any work done at all this morning. And it's all Yui-san's fault.\
　She did mention hiring a secretary, but she never said a word to me about advertising the position publicly.

She probably never imagined for a moment that I might want to be that secretary.

Yui-san doesn't expect me to take on that kind of role. I know that. But once the possibility occurred to me that it might be possible for me too — a desire welled up inside me, a desire not to let someone else take that precious position right beside Yui-san.

　Come lunchtime, Manager Yamazato must have noticed my lack of focus. "Are you tired? You can take a longer lunch break today," he said, sending me off to rest.

Seizing the chance to sort my thoughts, I headed to the break area. Sinking into the red, plush sofa, I sighed deeply and slumped my shoulders.

　You idiot, Yui. Why did you even hold an open call? If you'd chosen someone else from the start, I might have felt jealous, but I certainly wouldn't have wanted to be in her shoes. I wouldn't have felt this restless, this unsettled.

As these thoughts swirled, a sudden cold sensation touched my cheek — and I let out my second scream of the day.

"Hyah!"

"Kanata-chan, it's been a while. On your break? What are you doing here?"

A familiar male voice from distant memories made me snap my head up.\
The moment I met those eyes — deep, dark like the night sea — I froze in shock.

"Yu... Yukiyasu-san!?"

After popping the pull tab on the cold can of coffee he'd pressed against my cheek and handing it to me with a "Here you go," Yukiyasu-san sat down beside me.

"Er... ah, thank you very much."

"You're welcome."

Saying that, he flashed me a smile identical to Yui-san's. His well-groomed appearance was as impeccable as ever. The dark grey suit he wore gave him a clean, crisp look; Yukiyasu-san was like a male version of Yui-san. Being siblings, I suppose that's only natural.

But why on earth was he here? This was a building owned by the Ichinose Group. Yukiyasu-san had gone independent and started his own company, so he shouldn't have any connection to the group.

"Yukiyasu-san, what brings you here?"

"Oh? Has Yui not mentioned anything?"

Not mentioned what? I tilted my head in confusion. Yukiyasu-san then took a card case from his jacket's inside pocket and presented one card before me.

Seeing the title printed upon it, I straightened up abruptly.

"Yukiyasu-san, you are a director at our company? I'm terribly sorry, I had no idea about such an important matter...!"

Staring at his face in surprise, Yukiyasu-san smiled warmly.

"Don't worry about it. By the way, Kanata-chan, have you had lunch yet?"

Eh, lunch? Asked out of the blue like that, I shook my head from side to side.

"Good. I haven't eaten yet either. I tried asking Yui earlier, but she said she was busy. Would you like to join me?"

"Eh?"

I hadn't expected an invitation to lunch at all, and froze in surprise, still holding my canned coffee.\
Then, peering at my face, Yukiyasu pressed, "Don't you want to?"

　Somehow, this pushy side of him reminded me a little of Yui-san... There was no reason to refuse, so I nodded and said, "I'd love to join you."

＊＊＊

"Do you like pasta, Kanata-chan? There's a lovely place nearby. What do you think?"

"I like pasta."

"Oh, good."

　Walking alongside Yukiyasu-san, who naturally matched my pace, I began to feel as though I were walking with Yui-san. Really, they are so alike, Yukiyasu-san and Yui-san.

Entering a stylish restaurant reminiscent of a hideaway, we were shown to the counter and sat side by side. Apparently, it served lunch during the day and transformed into a bar at night. That explained its chic atmosphere.

"Order whatever you fancy. It's my way of thanking you for always looking after Yui."

Saying that, Yukiyasu handed me the menu with its thick cover.

"Thank you. But it's me who owes you favours. I feel terribly awkward accepting a meal..."

Even if it started by chance, I was now working at Yui's company after all.

My throat was parched with nerves. When I sipped the water offered, it had a faint hint of lemon flavour.

"Don't be so shy. If you're Yui's girlfriend, you're practically like my little brother, right?"

"Guh-ahh!!"

Girlfriend. That phrase dropped like a bomb, making me choke violently as I failed to swallow the water in my mouth.

"Are you alright?"

He patted my back with concern. Wiping my mouth with a napkin, I apologised reflexively, "Sorry," but no, wait, that's not it.

"Um, Yukiyasu-san, why did you say 'girlfriend'..."

"Oh, was I wrong? Yui told me Kanata-chan joined the company, so I just assumed you'd got back together. I mean, you were dating back in uni, weren't you?"

Yukiya-san said it matter-of-factly, as if it hadn't even registered. That's why I couldn't hide my shock.\
Because... Yui-san hadn't told Yukiyasu-san she was gay... had she?

　As if reading my wavering emotions, those same deep black eyes, like Yui's, narrowed gently — Ah, right, I remembered.\
I'd forgotten that Yukiyasu-san, like Yui, possesses incredibly keen insight.

That Yukiyasu-san had realised about Yui was something I never expected.
