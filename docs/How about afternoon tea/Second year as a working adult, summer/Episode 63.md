Episode 63: Kanata, Yuki-nii has a girlfriend, you know?

"Itadakimasu," I said, clasping my hands together before twirling the pesto around my fork. As I brought it to my mouth, the basil's fragrance filled my senses, and the chewy texture of the fresh pasta made me blurt out, "Wow, this is delicious."

Seeing my reaction, Yukiyasu-san gave a gentle smile before taking a bite of his carbonara.

"...I'd assumed you two were dating, but it was just a one-sided crush from Yui's side, wasn't it?"

"No, well... we weren't dating, but it wasn't exactly a one-sided crush either..."

Looking back, I'd already liked Yui-san since that time. To be honest, I don't know when I fell for her. By the time I realised, I was already fond of her. It just took me a little while to admit it...

"Is that so? That's good. I'm relieved."

When I implied that I also liked Yui, Yukiyasu-san smiled happily.

"So, Yukiyasu-san... you knew about Yui?"

I hesitated slightly, reluctant to use the phrase 'homosexual' in this context.

"The only one who hasn't realised is Dad. Even though they're engaged, I'd never heard her mention any romantic interest in men before that either. I did find it odd... but when I first met Kanata-chan, I knew for sure. Ah, so that's it – Yui likes women. I've never heard it from her mouth, so I just pretend I don't know."

　Indeed, it was only natural to find it odd that someone as beautiful as Yui-san, who was popular with both men and women, never had a single boyfriend. She seemed utterly disinterested in Kitakami-san too...

"Besides, Yui was ridiculously jealous of me back then, wasn't she? It was pretty obvious."

Saying this, Yukiyasu-san chuckled heartily. Pulling the memory back, I recalled that Yui really had been terribly sulky back then.

Truthfully, the relationship between Yui and me wasn't exactly something to be proud of. Given that she was engaged to Kitakami-san, regardless of how she felt, society would see me as the 'other woman'...\
But seeing Yukiyasu-san's attitude, I felt he accepted me rather favourably, and that gave me a little reassurance.

"...I don't know what happened, but things didn't work out when you were students, did they? You were so down about it, I reckon you must have genuinely liked her. If it was because of what happened with Shinji that you two broke up, then it was my fault... I've felt terribly guilty about it ever since. So, I'm really glad Kanata-chan came back to Yui."

"Eh...?"

　Why would it be Yukiyasu-san's fault? I stopped eating my pasta and looked at him. He lowered the outer corners of his eyebrows and smiled sadly.

"The reason Father is trying to make Yui the successor, even going so far as to make Shinji her fiancé, is because I, her elder brother, am hopeless. I've been running away from Father all this time, and the fallout has landed on Yui. I truly feel terribly sorry about that. That's why I accepted the director position too. When Yui first said she wanted to become president, Father dismissed her, saying she was too young. So she came crying to me. I never imagined Father would agree just because I became a director."

Ah, so that's why Yukiyasu-san, who shouldn't have had any connection to the group, ended up becoming a director.

Indeed, for Father, it was a precious chance to pull back a son who had once drifted away. There was no way he wouldn't agree. You really think things through, Yui.

"When I asked Yui why she wanted to become president so quickly, she said it was to break off her engagement with Shinji... So I decided to support her wholeheartedly. Honestly, I believe we've established a profitable management foundation over these past two years. This is the result of Yui's efforts... and also thanks to you, the driving force behind it all."

"Oh, I haven't done anything..."

Yui-san's efforts to break off the engagement weren't necessarily for my sake. After all, this reunion was truly coincidental. Even if she does like me now, it might just be a case of rekindled feelings...\
But if it really was for my sake... nothing could make me happier. A warmth slowly spreads deep within my chest.

I want Yui to live freely. I don't want her to live for my father or me at the expense of suppressing her true self. So, if you still care for Yui, I'll support the two of you. Father too... once he knows how hard Yui is trying, I'm sure he'll understand.

Hearing Yukiyasu-san say that somehow makes me feel incredibly reassured. That's right. I know from all the stories Yui's told me that her father, though awkward, is a deeply loving man.

He must have been genuinely delighted to hear about Yukiyasu-san becoming a director. They are father and son, after all.

But that doesn't mean my worries have vanished. Father is one thing... but would Kitakami-san be the sort to accept this?

　I heard Yui-san got engaged when she was eighteen. That means this autumn marks eight full years. Surely, after such a long engagement, the other party wouldn't just quietly step aside?

"Yukiyasu-san. Um... what sort of person is this Kitakami-san?"

When I asked, Yukiyasu-san furrowed his brow and made a sour face, humming thoughtfully.

"Well... for better or worse, he's the type with strong ambitions, I suppose. Ever since we were kids, he's been competing with me over everything... a real pain in the neck. Though I'll admit he's a hard worker."

He did say they were childhood friends, but it seemed Yukiyasu didn't think much of Kitakami either.\
Indeed, marrying Yui would undoubtedly secure him an important position within the Ichinose Group, and that would naturally require effort.

"Frankly, I opposed the engagement itself. I didn't say anything because Yui said she wanted it... but it really wasn't good at all. Not realising that back then was my fault."

I couldn't help but smile faintly at Yukiyasu-san, who let out a deep sigh. Yui-san really is loved, isn't she? Somehow, it made me feel incredibly tender.

"Yukiyasu-san. Is Kitakami-san... a necessary person in Yui-san's life?"

Four years ago, I stepped aside, believing he was the one Yui-san needed in her life, not me. That's why I wanted to ask. I wanted to know what Yukiyasu-san, who knew Kitakami-san well, thought.\
When I asked, Yukiyasu-san looked at me intently. So I, too, looked straight back into those eyes, so similar to Yui-san's.

"...That's not for Dad or me to decide. The person Yui needs is someone she should choose herself."

Hearing that, the lingering doubt deep within my chest seemed to vanish cleanly.\
Yes, that is something Yui-san should decide, not something for me to decide.

If Yui-san were to choose me this time — this time, I thought, I would never run away and leave you behind again.

　I'm so glad I got to see Yukiyasu today and talk with him. It felt like my doubts had cleared away, leaving me strangely refreshed.\
After polishing off the recommended fresh pasta, he even treated me to tea afterwards. This should help me focus on work this afternoon.

When I get back, I'll try telling Manager Yamazato how I feel. She might be reluctant, or it might be impossible. Still, I won't know unless I try.\
　I want to be there for Yui-san. Talking with Yukiyasu-san only strengthened that feeling.

"Oh, right, Kanata-chan. This time, you really must give me your contact details. If anything happens, you can always get in touch."

After exchanging contact details, Yukiyasu-san raised his index finger to his lips and said with a mischievous smile, "It's a secret from Yui, alright?"

　That smile was so much like Yui-san's. I couldn't help but smile back and promised, "I'll keep it a secret."

Leaving the shop, I glanced at my watch. It had been about an hour since we'd left at noon. Perfect timing.

We walked together back to the office. It was nice it was so close. By July, the midday sun was scorching hot.

"Are you heading back to Yui-san's place after this, Yukiyasu-san?"

"No. I've finished what I needed to do, so I'm heading back to my own company."

And yet he'd gone out of his way to walk me back to the office. The Ichinose family really were kind. When we reached the automatic doors, I bowed deeply to thank Yukiyasu-san.

"Thank you for lunch today."

"No, thank you for keeping me company. Well then, I shall..."

Just as Yukiyasu's voice trailed off with "I'll be off now," a familiar voice called out "Kanata!" making me turn around.

"...Why are Kanata and Yuki-nii together?"

Yui-san stood there, a plastic bag from the convenience store dangling from one hand, her brows knitted together in a sullen frown.

"I just invited her to lunch because we bumped into each other. Yui wouldn't come with me, you see. Right, Kanata-chan?"

"Y-yes. We just went for lunch together..."

Somehow, the atmosphere felt unpleasant. As I glanced nervously between the two of them, my arm was suddenly grabbed firmly, pulling me away from Yukiyasu-san.\
Yui-san peered at my face, looking flustered.

"Kanata, Yukiyasu-san has a girlfriend, you know?"

She said that, as if to emphasise something I hadn't even asked about, and I couldn't help but stare at her, wide-eyed.\
Then Yukiyasu-san laughed out loud, "Ahaha."

"You don't need to worry so much, I wasn't hitting on her. Right?"

Asked for agreement, I nodded vigorously. Yui-san always gets in a foul mood whenever Yukiyasu-san is mentioned.\
As I stood there flustered, wondering what to do, Yukiyasu-san looked at me and chuckled softly.

"Right then, I'll be off now. See you both later."

With that, he waved his hand lightly and simply walked away. I watched his retreating back. Better safe than sorry... he must have thought that.

"...Kanata."

Called by name, I turned awkwardly. Yui-san smiled unnaturally brightly and said to me, "Shall we go inside?"

"...Yui-san, is that all you had for lunch?"

While waiting for the lift, I stared at the convenience store bag in Yui-san's hand. One rice ball, salad, perhaps?

　With the grand opening of the new large resort hotel looming next month, Yui-san seemed so busy she couldn't even spare time for lunch in the company cafeteria.

"...What did you and Yuki-nii have to eat?"

When she asked me that, I realised I might have chosen the wrong topic. Because even though she looked like she was smiling, the depths of her eyes weren't smiling at all.

"Er, he treated me to pasta..."

"Hmm..."

The lift arrived, and we stepped inside. When the doors closed, the sudden silence felt a little awkward. This wasn't exactly the atmosphere where I could casually ask if I could volunteer to be her secretary either.

"You didn't have to go with Yuki-nii... I know better restaurants than that."

Yui-san muttered, turning her head away. I almost laughed out loud, quickly biting my lip to stifle it.

So, she was jealous after all. Yui-san, you're adorable.

I gently squeezed her fingertips. Her shoulder jerked in surprise, making me chuckle softly.

"Then next time, take me to a nice restaurant. On your day off."

"Is that... an invitation for a date?"

Her eyes widened as Yui peered at my face, just as the lift reached our floor.

It wouldn't do if anyone saw us chatting so casually, so I released our clasped fingers and stepped forward as the doors opened.\
Without answering her question, I turned back to Yui and said,

"Let's get back to work this afternoon, shall we?"

Yui-san was jealous. Maybe it's okay to think she still likes me after all.

The thought made me happy, and my steps towards the office felt light.
