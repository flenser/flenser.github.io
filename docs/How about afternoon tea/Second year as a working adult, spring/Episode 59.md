Episode 59: Let's Break Up, Right Now

"Kanata, wake up."

My shoulder was shaken, rousing me from my drowsiness. The swaying motion of the car had felt so pleasant that I must have dozed off for a moment. Before I could fully grasp the situation, Yui-san gently took my hand.

"Mind your step."

Prompted, I stepped out of the taxi. A cool night breeze brushed my cheek. My mind was still hazy from the alcohol. Only after the taxi door slammed shut and it drove off with a roar of its engine did I finally tilt my head in confusion. Why on earth had Yui-san got out too?

"Are you alright? Can you walk?"

I looked around, dazed. Standing before me was a high-rise apartment block, a world away from my own flat. The surroundings were unfamiliar.

"Wait, Yui-san, this isn't my place. Where are we...?"

Even as I said this, I let her take my hand and follow her. Yui-san held her card key up to the entrance of the high-rise. The automatic doors opened, and I stepped through as she urged me on.

"My place. I'm worried about letting you go home alone in this state."

Huh? Yui-san's place? Come to think of it, she'd mentioned buying a flat near the office before. I wasn't sure if I was that drunk to warrant such concern, but still... right, I could stay with her tonight. The thought made my cheeks relax naturally.

　Yui-san's flat was far more spacious than I'd imagined. Fitting for a company president, I suppose. The living room was nearly as large as that house I'd stayed in during my university days. It seemed almost wasteful for someone who only stayed overnight for work.

"I'll get you some water. Sit on the sofa."

She said this while peering at me with concern, but I shook my head from side to side.

"No, I don't need water. I'm just... so sleepy..."

The lingering drowsiness from leaning on Yui-san's shoulder earlier made me incredibly sleepy. My eyelids felt like they were about to droop shut. I almost lay down on the sofa to sleep, but Yui-san hurriedly stopped me.

"Kanata, if you're going to sleep, sleep in the bed. Sleeping on the sofa will make your body ache."

"Eh, but I haven't had a bath yet..."

"It's fine, don't worry about it. If you're this drunk, it'd be dangerous to take a bath, wouldn't it?"

Supporting my body, Yui-san said. Judging by her manner, I wasn't particularly aware of it myself, but apparently I was quite drunk. True, my chest felt a bit light-headed, and I had this sensation of being in a dream.

"The bedroom's this way. Come on."

She took my hand, and I simply followed. Beyond the door lay Yui-san's sparse bedroom, containing only a large bed. It overlapped somehow with Yui-san's room I remembered.

　Prompted to sit down, I settled onto the bed, my heart beginning to thump steadily. Even back in my student days, I'd slept in Yui-san's bed several times, and each time my heart had raced. After all, Yui-san's bed smelled absolutely wonderful.

Whether she knew this about me or not, Yui-san rummaged in the wardrobe, pulled out some nightwear, and plopped it onto my lap.

"You'll get tired if you sleep like that. Why not change before bed?"

She said this, looking down at me. True, I probably did want to change rather than sleep like this. Thinking that, I reached out both hands towards Yui.

"...Can't. Can't get it off. Yui-san, take it off for me."

"Eh?"

Yui-san, looking down at me, froze stiff as a board for a moment. Why was she so flustered?

Well, just today I'd ended up wearing a bloody fiddly outfit. The blouse buttons were at the back, and taking it off myself was a bit too tricky for me right now.

"Yui, hurry up."

Urging her with my arms still outstretched, Yui gave a wry smile and shook her head from side to side.

"No, that's a bit..."

Her attitude made me feel annoyed. Why was she so reluctant? The Yui from our school days would have definitely done it, even if she'd grumbled, "Oh, well, I suppose I have to." Why wouldn't the current Yui grant my request?

—Does she not like me anymore, perhaps?

As if to banish the unpleasant thought, I grabbed Yui-san's arm with my outstretched hand and pulled her back with all my strength, almost falling backwards myself.

"Whoa..."

Yui, having lost her balance, collapsed onto me as if falling over me. Trapped beneath her as she braced herself with both hands to avoid crushing me, I lay there, stretching my arms out as far as I could before she could escape, pulling her neck towards me.

"Ka... Kanata?"

Yui's voice sounded flustered in my ear. Before she could speak further, I buried my face in the nape of her neck and drew in a deep breath.

Sweet and nostalgic, a scent so beloved it made me want to cry.

"...It smells lovely."

I murmured it without thinking. A moment later, I realised Yui had, just as I'd wished, returned to wearing that same perfume from back then.

　Ah, thank goodness. The Yui from back then had finally returned to my arms. A warmth slowly spread deep within my chest at this embrace, four years in the making.

But the body I clung to remained stiff, and that frustrated me immensely. She would absolutely have hugged me back before. That wasn't amusing.

"...Didn't you say you'd become more tolerant of alcohol?"

With a tone of exasperation, Yui-san whispered in my ear, accompanied by a sigh.

"...I have become more tolerant, you know."

I am somewhat more tolerant than back then. I just drank a bit too much today. And it's all Yui-san's fault.

　If Yui hadn't been staring at Seno-san's chest, if she'd let go of her arm sooner, I wouldn't have ended up drinking like this.

"...Do you always get like this when you drink? Kanata, please, I beg you, don't ever drink outside again..."

Yui tried to sit up, creating a little distance between us, and I felt annoyed. Still, I kept my arm around her neck, refusing to let go.

　Those endlessly deep, dark eyes looking down at me. Eyes like the night sea, calm and still – I'd loved them so, so much ever since back then.

I wanted her to look at me more. Just me, forever, with those eyes.

As I stared back, still floating on the alcohol, Yui sighed softly.

"...Today, Niiyama-san was flirting with you, wasn't he? Has he been like that since you were at your previous company?"

Suddenly brought up, I tilted my head at the mention of Niiyama-san. I had absolutely no memory of being flirted with, but perhaps that's how it appeared to Yui-san. His flippant remarks were nothing new, and I'd never paid them much mind.

"...Niiyama-san is always like that. He doesn't mean it."

Come to think of it, Yui slumped her shoulders and sighed deeply.

"What if he was serious? He said he'd walk you home, didn't he? You really need to be careful. Kanata's easily swayed, you know."

Yui said that, but I'm much less easily swayed than I was in university. In fact, Niiyama-san has invited me out for dinner several times, but I've never once accepted.

"And you, Yui-san... you were looking at Seno-san's chest today, weren't you? Didn't you feel pleased when she put her arm around you? You're such a lecher, Yui-san."

Frowning without hiding her displeasure, Yui-san widened her eyes and shook her head from side to side.

"No, that's not it. That was force majeure... I really didn't mean to look like that."

"Hmm... Really? You seem suspicious. Are you still chasing women, perhaps?"

I've known since our school days just how popular this person is. Her beauty captivates women everywhere.

There's nothing about her that isn't alluring. Yui-san has always been like that. If she wanted to, she could easily charm one or two girls with her sweet, addictive whisper, as sugary as sugar itself.

　I knew her left-hand nails were longer than they used to be, but even so, I think I wanted to hear her say it wasn't true.

Yui gave a soft laugh, then shook her head as if to deny it.

"Of course not. I've been swamped with work... I haven't had the time."

"...Really?"

"Are you jealous, by any chance? How sweet."

"Not at all... I'm not jealous or anything..."

Despite having been startled and stiff just moments before, Yui-san had already reverted to her usual composed manner. She gazed at me and smiled teasingly.

Having my jealousy seen through felt both pleasant and embarrassing. As I abruptly looked away, Yui-san gently stroked my cheek with one hand.

"...Do you have a boyfriend at the moment, Kanata?"

A boyfriend...? I hadn't expected such a question and turned my gaze back to Yui. Stared at by those serious black eyes, I almost shook my head to say no, but I reconsidered.

Come to think of it, I recalled how Ritsu had been genuinely shocked when I mentioned I hadn't had a boyfriend for four years.

To say I'd always liked Yui-san... that would be a bit much, wouldn't it? Yui-san doesn't like troublesome girls, and what on earth would be the right thing to say? My alcohol-addled brain wouldn't turn properly, and while I agonised over the answer, Yui-san's expression, looking down at me, clouded over before my eyes.

"...Kanata."

Yui, clearly losing patience, urged me on, and the words slipped out before I could stop them.

"...What would you do if I said I do?"

I genuinely wanted to know. I didn't think she disliked me. But just from her attitude, I couldn't tell if she still felt the same intensity for me as she once did.

　Then Yui-san drew her beautifully shaped brows together sharply, wrinkling her forehead and making an unmistakably displeased face.

"...Break up with him. Right now."

I hadn't expected her to say something like that, so I found myself laughing out loud.

When I laughed out loud, "Ahaha," Yui-san looked even more sullen and displeased.

"Why are you laughing?"

"Well... you've got a fiancé yourself, don't you?"

The sheer unreasonableness of her demand made me laugh involuntarily. I never imagined Yui-san, who always respected me, would make such a selfish demand. And I'd never admit out loud how incredibly pleased it made me.

When I pointed this out, Yui-san snapped back, her voice tinged with panic.

"Shinji and I aren't in a romantic relationship, and I'm breaking off the engagement next year, I told you. More importantly, what's your boyfriend like, Kanata? How long have you been together?"

A smile spilled over. Could I take that to mean she still liked me? This definitely meant she was interested, right? Or was I just wanting to believe that?

"Does it interest you?"

She asked while playing with the long, silky black hair spilling over me as she leaned in. Then Yui let out a small sigh.

"...Do you prefer men, after all?"

I only wanted her to be jealous, but Yui looked so sad when she said that, I couldn't bear it and shook my head.

"Just kidding. I couldn't possibly have a boyfriend, could I?"

As I stroked her cheek, Yui-san's eyes widened in surprise for a moment, then she let out a deep sigh of relief.

"...Kanata, since when did you become so mean?"

Her resentful gaze pierces me like a needle. She probably still doesn't realise that even a single glance like that is enough to make me happy.

"Don't sulk, Yui-san. Let's drop this, shall we? Come on, I'm sleepy... Let's sleep together."

Saying that, I pull her neck close to me. Ah, that lovely scent again. Perfume and Shachi-kun alone just weren't enough.
The real thing is completely different. A slow, steady wave of euphoria washes over me. Yui-san's scent is addictive, I think.

"Kanata—"

Ignoring her reproachful, bewildered voice, I tighten my arms around her.

"...Hold me tight, like we used to, until I fall asleep, the whole time."

When I begged like that, Yui-san sighed deeply, as if resigned. Then she moved off me and lay down beside me, pulling my body close to hers.

Held so tightly I could barely breathe, our bodies pressed together, my strength drained away.

　It felt so incredibly good that I closed my eyes.

As she gently stroked my back, drowsiness washed over me like a wave.

"...This is torture..."

I heard Yui-san whisper something in my ear, but not a shred of consciousness remained for me to understand its meaning.
