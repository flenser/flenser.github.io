Episode 53: I Just Wondered If It Might Be Fate

Led by the hand, I was brought to a sushi restaurant frequented by Yui-san, one with an undeniably upmarket appearance. Before stepping inside, I must admit I felt rather daunted, but once settled at the counter, the delightful aroma of vinegared rice made my stomach rumble loudly.

　Not knowing where to start, I left it to the chef for my first piece. I dabbed a little soy sauce onto the glistening, translucent white flesh and took a bold bite.

One mouthful, and my eyes widened involuntarily.

"Mmm, delicious...!"

Seeing me murmur in delight, Yui-san, seated beside me, smiled happily.

"Kanata, you still eat so deliciously. It's adorable."

"Adorable," she said. Hearing that, I felt a sudden tightening deep in my chest. Hastily averting my gaze, Yui-san smiled and brought her own sushi to her mouth.

"So, Yui-san, you always eat such delicious things, don't you..."

Well, she is the president, after all. She must earn a hefty salary too. Seeing her like this now, I felt she had gained a more mature composure compared to back then.

　As I watched her with interest, Yui-san shook her head with a smile.

"I don't eat like this all the time, you know. Only on special occasions. When work slows down a bit, or as a treat for myself."

Freshly made sushi arrived from behind the counter. Squid this time, perhaps? With delicious sushi arriving one after another, this place felt like heaven.

"Then why did you bring me here today? Did the business talks with my company go well, or something?"

With a pop, I stuffed another piece into my mouth and tentatively probed. Honestly, I couldn't fathom any connection between Yui's company and mine.
Not sure if she'd tell me, I asked anyway. Yui just smiled and shook her head again.

"No. Not that... It's because I got to see you again. Today's a special day for me."

Staring straight into my eyes, Yui said it so casually. Oh, for heaven's sake. Hearing that, I couldn't stop my heart from racing against my will.
I should have known she was the sort to say things like that so nonchalantly. Regaining the immunity I lost over these four years is going to take a while longer.

"Um... Yui-san, why were you at our company? We haven't done business together before, have we?"

Well, there was no helping it now. I decided to just ask outright.
When she saw my face that afternoon, Yui-san had genuinely looked shocked. So she definitely hadn't known I worked for this company.
It felt like nothing short of divine mischief – such a truly coincidental reunion.

"Well, we haven't done any business with Kanata's company yet. Why I was here... that's still a secret."

She still wouldn't tell me. I understood, of course. If business did come up in the future, I'd be an employee of a client company. She couldn't carelessly leak information.

"I won't tell anyone... you could tell me, you stingy Yui-san."

"Sorry, don't sulk. I can't say now, but you'll find out eventually."

Really? When I gave her a sceptical look, Yui-san just laughed and stuffed another piece of sushi into her mouth, as if to distract me. I followed suit, taking another bite. The rich, fatty otoro was so exquisite it felt like my cheeks might literally fall off.

　Only now did it occur to me that talking while eating something delicious isn't a good idea. This flavour threatened to gloss over everything, everything.

Suddenly, as if remembering something, I stared at Yui-san's left hand. Slightly long nails with polish. On her white, long ring finger, there was still no ring.
Earlier, I'd felt relieved she wasn't wearing one, but knowing Yui-san, I couldn't quite dismiss the possibility she simply wasn't wearing it.

　My curiosity got the better of me, and words I should have kept to myself slipped out.

"...You're not married yet, are you?"

"Hm? Ah, yeah."

Noticing my gaze fixed on her left ring finger, Yui answered nonchalantly.

"When... are you going to?"

I didn't want to ask, but I did. I know it's contradictory. Then those dark eyes fixed on mine, as if seeing straight through my thoughts. As ever, I couldn't tell what those dark eyes were thinking.

"I won't. I've no intention of marrying."

"Eh...? W-what about the engagement? Did you call it off?"

"No, not yet. But once this quarter's accounts are finalised, I intend to tell Father. If I want to push through my own ideas, I can't just show up empty-handed without any track record, can I? This company had been underperforming for ages, so I saw it as an opportunity. I asked to be put in charge, promising I'd deliver results within three years. And this year marks the third year... I intend to deliver solid results and prove that we can manage just fine without Shinji."

　Frankly, I was surprised. After all, during university, Yui hadn't seemed particularly keen on company management. She didn't even appear interested. Amazing. People can change this much in just four years.

"...Yui, you must have worked incredibly hard."

　I thought about Yui's four years of effort and hardship. While I was whining and clinging to memories, Yui had kept pushing forward, working tirelessly. The thought that perhaps only I had been left behind all that time made me feel terribly sad.

"Getting dumped by Kanata woke me up. Realising that if you give up, you'll never get what you want – that was all thanks to Kanata."

　Thanks to me, eh? I wonder what it is Yui-san truly wants.
After breaking off the engagement, what next? Does she want a new romance... or something like that?

Four whole years have passed since then. Am I no longer in Yui-san's heart?

"I... don't recall ever rejecting Yui-san."

True, I did say we should part ways, but I did tell you I liked you. So, in my mind, I didn't break up with you.
When I blurted that out in desperation, Yui-san laughed out loud, "Ahaha."

After leaving the shop, it had grown completely dark outside. I'd harboured just a tiny bit of hope, but she didn't invite me to the next place.
Well, I suppose that makes sense. Tomorrow's a weekday too, and unlike me, Yui-san must be busy.

"Kanata, I'll drive you home. My car's parked nearby."

"Eh, it's alright, you don't need to go to that trouble. I can catch the train home."

Feeling bad, I shook my head from side to side. Yui-san bent down slightly and peered up at my face. Her mischievous eyes stared intently into mine.

"...You don't need to be so wary. I'm not going to attack you or anything, you know?"

"N-no, it's not that! It's just... I thought you were busy, Yui-san..."

"If that's the case, don't worry about it. Come on, let's go."

Saying that, she took my hand. That warm palm, unchanged from those days. I couldn't possibly pull away; I could only let myself be led silently by that hand.

The car parked in the lot was different from the one I remembered Yui-san driving. A white luxury saloon. This time, it didn't seem to be a Japanese make.

"...Yui-san, you've changed your car, haven't you?"

"Hm? Ah, yes. But this is also Yuki-nii's hand-me-down, you know. I don't really mind what it is, as long as it runs."

Saying that, she opened the passenger door for me, just as she always had. But getting into this unfamiliar car, I noticed a scent different from my memory.

Yui-san got into the driver's seat a little later. Huh— I thought. I hadn't noticed it earlier, but being alone with her in this enclosed space, the scent felt different from back then.
Oh, I see... Yui-san... you changed your perfume.

The car began to move slowly.

Over these four years, I hadn't changed a bit. But Yui-san had. Suddenly, a sharp ache welled up inside me, stinging deep in my chest.

"This is fine here. That's my flat, you see..."

She flicked on the hazard lights and pulled over beside the building. With no further plans, I'd already arrived home.
Could it be that, in Yui-san's mind, I'd truly become just a memory? Perhaps she'd simply been surprised by our chance meeting, felt nostalgic, and invited me to dinner for that reason alone. Maybe she genuinely felt nothing more now.

Would this be the last time I saw Yui-san? As I hastily unbuckled my seatbelt, Yui turned back towards me.

"Oh, right, Kanata. Do you have any business cards? I'll give you mine, so hand yours over."

"Eh? A business card?"

I didn't usually carry them, but I was sure I had one tucked away in my wallet.
Fumbling frantically in my bag for it, Yui pulled a cardholder from her inside pocket and handed me one of hers.

　Then, Yui stared intently at the card I handed her.

"Web Production Division... Management Control Team..."

After reading out my department, Yui suddenly smiled happily.

"Um, what is it?"

"Oh, nothing. I just thought... maybe it's fate that we've met again like this."

Hearing that, my heart leapt. Please don't speak of fate so lightly.
Even if you didn't mean it, those words carry such immense weight for me.

"...Yui-san, you're still the same in that way. Womaniser."

Saying this with a sulky tone, Yui-san smiled and reached out to me. Startled, I froze, and she gently stroked the edge of my ear.

"I've been meaning to say this for ages... you're still wearing those earrings, aren't you?"

I gasped involuntarily. Wearing these earrings, given to me by Yui-san, had become so natural to me that I hadn't even noticed I was wearing them today. Embarrassed, my cheeks grew hot.

"I-is that not alright?　...I mean, I just like them, there's no deeper meaning or anything..."

"No, it's not that. I'm really happy."

Her hand, which had been gently stroking my ear, withdrew, then clasped mine tightly.
Why? How come? Why would she hold my hand?
Uncertain of her true meaning, I timidly looked up at Yui-san, and her eyes softened into a gentle squint.

"Hey, Kanata. ...Will you meet me again?"

Those eyes, as deep and dark as ever, captured my heart and wouldn't let go.
For four years, I'd been so terribly lonely, so terribly sad. It might be an excuse, but I think it was because I'd felt the warmth of that hand again — a hand I thought I'd let go of.

Even though I knew I shouldn't, all I could do was nod silently.
