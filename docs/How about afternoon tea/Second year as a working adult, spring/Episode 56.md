Episode 56: This Time, Let's Both Give Yui a Proper Thrashing

"Kanata-chan, it's been ages! You've grown into such a young lady since I last saw you!"

As I opened the front door, there stood Ritsu-san, her familiar, lively voice and bright smile unchanged from those days. Behind her stood Yūri.

"Ritsu-san, it's been ages. Thank you for coming."

Right after meeting Yui-san, I decided to go to her company. During the subsequent HR interview, I told them so without hesitation.

That's why I ended up moving near the office. When I complained to Yuri about how tough packing was, she offered to help — and that's how Ritsu-san ended up coming too.

　I heard later that, surprisingly, most members of the web production department had decided to join the new company. Mitsuya-san too, of course.\
And no wonder – the salary offered during the interview was a full thirty thousand yen higher than the base pay at our current company.

After the announcement, the initial commotion within the company gradually subsided. The handover of duties concluded, and the date for our transfer was set in quick succession.

　My flat is a one-bedroom, not exactly spacious, but having lived here since my third year of university, I've accumulated quite a bit of stuff. My new place is also a one-bedroom, but I figured I'd use this as an opportunity to get rid of all the clothes and books I don't need.

　I poured iced tea into glasses as we both entered the living room. I'd seen Yuri frequently, but it had been four years since I last saw Ritsu-san – that one time was the last.

"Ritsu-san, when did you return to Tokyo?"

"I moved back at the end of March. I enjoyed Osaka, but I have more friends in Tokyo, so I was lucky to get transferred. I saw Yui the other day too, after ages, and I was really shocked to hear about Kanata-chan."

　With that, Ritsu chuckled heartily. Her hair was still the same length, loosely curled, but the bright colour from her university days had now settled into a subdued dark tone. Her gentle, slightly drooping eyes remained unchanged, bringing back a wave of nostalgia.

"I was shocked too. I never imagined I'd meet Yui-san again like this."

It made me think that fate really does exist.

"About that thing, I wanted to ask you, Kanata... Are you really sure it was the right decision to work at your senior's company? I mean, she hasn't broken off the engagement yet, has she? Isn't it hard being so close?"

Yuri suddenly murmured this as she sipped her iced tea. Her expression made it clear she was finding it difficult to say, and I immediately realised she was worried about me.

　Before I could reply, Ritsu turned to Yuri and said,

"You can trust Yui. That girl really changed after Kanata dumped her. She was utterly devastated afterwards... But she studied desperately, worked her absolute guts out. That Yui, you know? You can trust her. She'll be absolutely fine."

Though she's always swearing and grumbling, it's clear Ritsu genuinely cares deeply for Yui-san. Because at times like this, Ritsu always ends up defending her.

Then Yuri, not to be outdone, interrupted Ritsu with a "But—"

"Ritsu-san. I'm worried that Ichinose-senpai might hurt Kanata again. Kanata was really down after they split up, you know! She's so cute, yet she's been stuck on senpai all this time, not even getting a boyfriend, just..."

　I was a bit taken aback hearing Yuri say "cute". I hurriedly grabbed Yuri's arm, sensing she'd only get more worked up if left alone. Realising she thought of me that way made me feel just a little embarrassed.

"Ah, um, Yuri, calm down..."

Then Ritsu-san widened her eyes in surprise, saying, "No way!"

"Eh, not a single one? Kanata-chan, you mean you haven't dated anyone since then? For four whole years?"

"That's right! Right, Kanata?"

"Eh, ah... well... yes, but..."

You don't have to be so shocked... Is that weird? Actually, Yuri knew I'd been hung up on Yui-san all this time...

　I hadn't realised at all, but apparently I'm really transparent. Does it show on my face or in my attitude? I could feel my cheeks burning, almost as if they were about to pop.

"How devoted... I can certainly understand why Yuri would be worried..."

"Right!? Next time she makes Kanata cry, even if she is Ritsu-san's best friend, I won't forgive her."

Yuri slammed her iced tea glass down on the table and declared loudly. I’d thought myself lucky to have such a good friend, but she knew I still liked Yui-san, and from the way the conversation had gone, I was sure Ritsu must have picked up on it too.\
Embarrassed, I covered my flushed face with both hands.

"Right then. If by any chance that ever happens, this time we'll beat the living daylights out of Yui together. Give her a proper thrashing. Seriously."

After clasping hands firmly and sealing their ominous pact, Ritsu and Yuri reconciled. I was the one involved, yet somehow I felt left out.\
　Feeling unbearably awkward, I tried to change the subject. After moistening my mouth with iced tea, I told them in a weak voice.

"Um... we should probably get packing soon..."

"Ah, sorry, we forgot."

Hearing them both say that in unison, I felt deflated and slumped my shoulders.

＊＊＊

Then, thanks to their help, the move went smoothly, and before I knew it, the memorable day of my first day at work arrived.\
Just for today, I dressed in a suit I wasn't quite used to and made my way to the office. The weather was warm enough to hint at summer approaching. Bringing my parasol had been the right call.

Ever since that day I sulked about not getting a message, Yui-san started messaging me every day.

　Just simple things like 'Good morning', 'Good night', or 'What did you have for dinner?', but it made me incredibly happy that Yui-san found time in her busy schedule to think of me and send me messages.

Last night too, a message arrived from Yui-san.

'Looking forward to seeing Kanata at the office tomorrow.'

No emojis, just her usual simple message, but that was fine. Because surely, I was the only one. That Yui-san, who's usually so bad at keeping in touch, sending messages every single day to someone.

From today, our relationship is president and employee. I'm sure we won't be able to chat casually around the office anymore. Even so, if you're there every day, even just in the corner of my vision, I'm sure my working life will be more enjoyable than it has been until now. I felt that way.

"Good morning, Aosawa-chan."\
"Good morning, Mitsuya-san."

The company building where I first visited Yui-san was easily twice the size of the one I'd been working in until now. It appeared to be owned by the Ichinose Group, with their offices occupying three entire floors of the building. Other group companies seemed to be housed on different floors of the same building.

After receiving a brief explanation about the building, we waited in a conference room as spacious as a university lecture theatre.\
　We, the nearly thirty former employees of the Web Production Division, had been informed beforehand that the production team members would be assigned to a newly established department, while sales and administrative staff would be placed in departments suited to their aptitudes.

Today, after the induction ceremony, we would receive our official appointment letters. Following that, there would be an orientation, and our actual department assignments would be made at a later date.

"I came without hesitation, thinking the pay would be better, but I'm still a bit nervous, you know."

"Yeah..."

We'd decided to keep it quiet within the company that I knew Yui-san beforehand. Otherwise, it'd probably make things awkward for her too. That said, I doubt most employees ever get the chance to speak with the president.

Five minutes before the appointed time, the conference room door opened. When Yui-san appeared, a murmur rippled through the room.

"That person is the president? Wow, she's absolutely stunning..."

　Mitsuya-san murmured in surprise. Of course she is, Yui-san is incredibly beautiful, I thought, feeling a surge of pride even though it wasn't about me.\
I was genuinely stunned the first time I met Yui-san too. I like her in casual clothes, but she looks absolutely stunning in a suit as well. Thinking this, I followed Yui-san with my eyes as she took the stage.

I thought our eyes met just once, when Yui-san looked up. Yui-san smiled softly and took hold of the microphone.

＊＊＊

"They say God doesn't give two gifts to one person, right? But there are people who get two, even three. The world's unfair, isn't it..."

Mitsuya-san sighed as she said this, gently rubbing her shoulders, stiff with tension and fatigue.

　The induction ceremony, appointment letter handover, and orientation flew by in a flash.\
I hadn't had time to speak with Yui-san, but when she handed me my letter, she looked me straight in the eye and smiled. Just that alone made today worthwhile.

"Still, it's good we're in the same department again. Management Control."

"That's right. I'm glad I got to be with Aosawa-chan."

The manager from the former management team apparently requested an internal transfer rather than going to Yui-san's company. So, only Mitsuya-san and I ended up assigned to the Management Department.

I hear the job content hasn't changed much either. What's more, looking at the seating chart, my desk was right near the president's office. I'd been thinking it would be a shame if it were on another floor, but it seems management departments are grouped near the president's office, so I reckon I was lucky.

Admittedly, the first day was tiring, but my mood was incredibly bright.

After all, from tomorrow, I'd get to see Yui-san every day.

That alone made any worries about the future vanish somewhere.

My steps felt light. I had a feeling the gears that had been stuck for four years were about to start turning again.
