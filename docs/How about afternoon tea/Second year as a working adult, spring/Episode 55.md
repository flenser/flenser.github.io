Episode 55: I Reckon You Could Send a Message In Three Seconds Flat

"Good work today!"

Eighteen minutes past six. I hold my employee ID card up to the clocking-in system as if slamming it down, then hurry towards the lift.

The boss only just told me off the other day about not running in the corridors, but I couldn't care less now.

I press the 'Down' button repeatedly, then catch my breath. Just my luck, the lift was far above my floor, and I nearly let out a sigh.

I wish it would hurry up. As I waited, fidgeting, a voice suddenly called out from behind me, making me jump and straighten up.

"Aosawa-san, heading home already?"

Turning around, I saw Niiyama-san from the production team standing there, holding a convenience store iced coffee. Even though it was already quitting time, he seemed to be heading back to work.

　He's twenty-seven, three years my senior, and has been a key member of the production team since I joined the company.

"Yes. It's quitting time... so I'm heading home."

Ah, I thought, caught by someone I don't particularly like. Just my luck, the lift was stuck on a higher floor and wouldn't come down. Niiyama-san narrowed his eyes and stared at me intently, uttering a low "Huh".

　As far as I know, Niiyama-san works overtime almost every day; I've never seen him leave on time.

Leaving on time is a good thing. Overtime isn't exactly fashionable these days. While I genuinely believe that myself, I sometimes get the feeling he doesn't think very highly of leaving early. To be honest, I found Niiyama-san a bit difficult.

"Rushing off like that — date with your boyfriend?"

"...No. I don't have a boyfriend."

Not a boyfriend. Not a date. But the person I like is waiting downstairs right now. So I don't have time to chat with you.

I felt myself getting a bit annoyed, but managed to hold it in and feign calm. Finally, the long-awaited lift arrived, so I ignored Niiyama-san and stepped inside.

"Hey, Aosawa-san. If you don't have a boyfriend, fancy going on a date with me sometime?"

This guy, grinning with one side of his mouth turned up like that, really gets on my nerves. I absolutely hate his hair too – plastered flat with so much wax it reflects the lights.

"...Thanks for your hard work today."

Without answering his invitation, I hammered the 'Close' button without a word.

Over these past four years, I've changed quite a bit myself. I'm gradually learning to properly decline even the most forceful invitations that would have swept me along before.

　I caught my reflection in the lift mirror and hastily smoothed my hair. I'd discreetly touched up my make-up in the washroom before clocking out. So I should be fine.

I placed a hand over my chest, trying to steady the relentless pounding of my heart, and took a breath. The lift finally reached the ground floor, and I left the company building with a perfectly composed expression.

　The infuriating person who’d ignored me for three weeks was waiting with her usual smile.

“Kanata, good work today.”

When we met the other day, Yui-san was wearing a suit, probably for a business meeting, but today she was in casual clothes. Still in great shape. I almost get lost staring.

“…Good work today.”

The night I was told about the business sale, a simple message arrived from Yui-san.

　‘Can we meet Friday night?’ That was all. I wanted to ask if she had nothing else to say, but I’d decided to save my complaints until I saw her face.

I’m glad to see her. But I’m still a bit sulky. Yui seemed to sense from the tone of my first words that I wasn’t in the best mood. She tilted her head to look at my face, so I abruptly looked away.

"Yui, you've been terribly busy since then, haven't you..."

"Ah, yeah. Work's been piling up lately..."

"Hmm..."

Well, she is the president. With the sale and all, she obviously doesn't have time like she did in her student days. Yui and I are in completely different positions now. But still.

"...I reckon you could spare three seconds to send a message."

　When I said that rather sarcastically, Yui let out a soft chuckle. Why are you laughing? I was about to complain, looking up at her face. But then, those incredibly gentle eyes were fixed on me, and I found myself unable to say anything.

"Were you waiting for me to get in touch?"

"...Well, you did say you wanted to meet again. And yet, you didn't even... send a single message..."

Oh dear, am I being terribly 'difficult' right now? Realising this fact only now made me feel a little timid, and as my voice grew fainter and fainter, Yui-san smiled and took my hand.

"Yes, you're right. Sorry for being so thoughtless. I'll be more careful next time. To make it up to you, let's go eat something you like today. Anything you want. What would you like?"

Deep inside my chest, something tingled. Ever since I was younger, I'd always liked you – the way you'd cheer me up without complaint whenever I sulked over silly things.

"Anything?"

"Yes, anything."

That gentle gaze fixed on me felt so familiar, it made my chest tighten.

"Then... I'd like some dashimaki tamago. From an izakaya."

When I said it like I was begging, Yui-san asked me back, "Is that really all right?" That's all right. Honestly, as long as you're with me, even a chain izakaya is fine.

I nodded, and Yui-san smiled, saying "Right then," and took my hand.

＊＊＊

"Have you heard from the president yet?"

As I was topping the fluffy, dashi-scented rolled omelette with grated daikon, she suddenly asked that. I looked up at Yui-san sitting opposite me.

"Heard" must mean about that business sale. I gave a single nod, then stuffed a mouthful of rolled omelette in. Yeah, izakaya dashimaki tamago really is the best.

"I never imagined Kanata was in that division. I was genuinely shocked."

"...I was the one who was shocked. Because you never said a word about it, Yui-san."

"I'm sorry. I really wanted to tell you sooner, but I thought it was only right for the president to tell you himself, not someone from outside. I decided to keep quiet until I heard it had been announced to the staff."

Well, thinking about it now, I suppose it couldn't be helped. You can't exactly announce, "We're acquiring the division you're in right now."

"I see... I heard the interviews start next week. About salary conditions and such. They did say that if I wish to stay, they'll try to accommodate me as much as possible, if feasible..."

Production department staff will be transferred to Yui-san's company without question. However, I heard that sales and administrative staff might remain depending on individual circumstances. Whether requests will be granted remains uncertain.
What Yui-san likely wants is the production team. Sales and administration are probably just extras.

"...Kanata, what do you want to do?"

Those dark eyes fixed on me intently. I knew she was asking seriously, so I stopped eating and looked back at Yui.

"Honestly, I'm torn. I've only just joined, and I liked my current job and this company..."

"Kanata, you were in the management team, weren't you? Our company has a Management Control Department too, so if you come, I intend to assign you to the same department."

Hearing her state it so clearly, I wondered — if I wasn't imagining things — whether Yui-san actually wanted me to join.

"Um... Yui-san, wouldn't you mind? Having me there?"

When I timidly asked this, Yui-san's eyes widened in surprise, as if she hadn't expected such a question.

"Not at all. Quite the opposite, actually. I'd be delighted."

Wasn't she uncomfortable? Even if I wasn't her ex-girlfriend, wasn't she hesitant about bringing a woman she'd once been involved with into her own company?

I—I wouldn't mind working under Yui-san. But some conditions would worsen. Like the office location, for instance.

"I see. ...But I'm still a bit hesitant. It would mean a longer commute too."

"Why not move? I bought a flat near the office, you could live there?"

"Eh?"

Suddenly told that, now it was my turn to widen my eyes. She bought a flat? Near the office?

"Yui-san, you don't live in that house anymore...?"

What had become of that house where Yui-san and I lived for a year? I felt nostalgic for those times we'd snuggle up on the sofa watching films. If she really wasn't living there anymore, I thought it would be rather sad. I'd always assumed Yui-san would be there, in that house.

When I asked her that, Yui-san shook her head from side to side.

"I only stay at the flat when work gets busy. It's strictly for work. So, you're welcome to live there, Kanata. There's a spare room anyway."

I couldn't help but give a wry smile at Yui-san saying such things so casually. It seems she still spoils me just as much as ever. I'm glad, but still.

"...Is it really okay to give special treatment to an employee?"

When I pointed that out, Yui-san smiled brightly.

"You're not an employee yet, are you? You could just move in before you become one."

Honestly, it was charming and flattering that she'd say that... but no, I wouldn't live with her. As I shook my head from side to side, Yui's hand reached out and gently grasped mine, as if to seal the deal.

Just that alone made my heart leap in an almost amusing way.

Back in our student days, Yui had seemed far more hesitant. When we last met, Yui-san declared flatly, "I have no intention of marrying." Perhaps that's why. Even though the fact she has a fiancé now hasn't changed — that single sentence seems to have shattered the mental brake that had definitely been there four years ago.

I couldn't pull my hand away.

"...I want you to see me now, Kanata. I'm not the same as I was when we were students."

Her earnest gaze made me almost forget to breathe.

"If you don't want to live in my flat, I'll arrange company accommodation near the office. So please come work for my company. I beg you. ...Can't you give me one more chance?"

What chance...? I swallowed the urge to ask. Right now, I was still too afraid to hear the answer.

"I won't disappoint you again. ...I'll work hard to prove myself worthy of your reconsideration."

My heart pounded.

　Meeting Yui again made me realise. No matter how long we were apart, my feelings never changed. I know I'd fall for you again, time and time over. I think that's just how fate works.

"...I'll think about it."

When I said that, Yui smiled as if relieved and murmured, "Thank you."

＊＊＊

I'd thought it before, but going home to separate houses with Yui felt strangely off somehow. Yui-san had come by car to see me off, and hadn't touched a drop of alcohol, which made me feel rather guilty.

The unfamiliar passenger seat and the scent of her new perfume. I didn't dislike it, but it felt different from my memories, unsettling. I wished she'd go back to the way she was. Lost in such thoughts, I surrendered myself to the moving car.

"Come to think of it... what's happened to my room?"

The mention of that house made me a little curious, so I asked.

"It's just as it was. Ready for whenever Kanata might come back."

Hearing that stirred up an indescribable feeling, a mix of happiness and ache. Had she really been waiting all this time? For my return, in that house.

"Let's watch a film together again. In fact, since tomorrow's a day off, why not come over now?"

"Eh...? N-no, I won't come today. Being invited to your place at this hour, Yui-san, makes me feel like..."

...like you might be thinking something naughty. I hesitated to voice it, but sensing what I wanted to say, Yui-san smiled slightly and spoke.

"...I won't do anything."

"...I can't trust your 'won't do anything', Yui-san. You've got a whole history of it..."

When I pointed that out, Yui laughed out loud, ahaha. See? That way of laughing it off hasn't changed a bit.

"That's because you're too cute, Kanata."

...She said 'cute' again. I fought to keep my cheeks from softening, turning towards the window so she wouldn't notice. Ah, we'll be at my place soon.

　I don't want to go home. I want to stay with her longer. I can't stop myself from thinking that.

Going to her company... earlier I said I'd "think about it"... but my mind was already made up.

Both Yui and I are different from back then. Perhaps we can envision a future different from four years ago.

Is it okay to dream again? There I was, beginning to hope.
