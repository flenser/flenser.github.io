Episode 61: Why Are You So Adorable?

My heart fluttered uncontrollably at the thought of our first date in ages.

After breakfast, I asked Yui-san if I could pop back home to change clothes.

I wanted her to see the new outfit I'd bought especially for the date. Though I worried she might think it was a faff to change, I got ready and returned to the car where Yui-san was waiting. When she complimented me, saying "You look lovely," I truly felt it had been worth buying the new clothes for today.

　After parking at the nearest lot, I pointed the way to the shop, saying, "This way," when Yui-san took my hand and held it. Looking up, she was smiling happily.

"Yui-san, what's this hand-holding business...?"

We always walked hand-in-hand back in our student days, and I wasn't asking because I wanted her to let go. It was just me trying to hide my embarrassment. Whether she noticed or not, Yui-san looked at me with her usual calm expression.

"It's a date, isn't it? What's the harm?"

"...I won't be responsible if someone from work sees us, you know?"

"It's fine. I'll cover for us if it happens."

She said it so casually, but did she really think it was okay if someone saw us? Yui-san was truly unpredictable.\
I never had any intention of pulling away from the hand she'd taken without hesitation. Instead, I squeezed hers back tightly.

　When I found out Yui-san had come to like tea, I decided I absolutely had to introduce her to this shop first.

It's originally a long-established shop in England. Thankfully, it's a specialist tea shop that also has branches in Japan. It's been my regular since I lived in London, and I still visit every time I go back.\
They have a huge variety, not just limited to tea, so I'm sure we'll find something to suit Yui-san's taste.

"I had no idea there were so many varieties of tea."

"Did you say you like Earl Grey, Yui-san?"

"Yes, it smells lovely. And I drink milk tea in the mornings. I buy it from a shop."

Hearing that, I recalled how Yui-san always carried a drink cup from the milk tea specialist shop near the station when heading to work.

"If you like milk tea, I recommend Breakfast. I often buy mine here too."

I pick up the familiar green tin. The design on this tin is really rather lovely, isn't it? It's a bit pricier than the sort of tea you can easily buy at the supermarket... but then, I suppose I'm willing to spend a little more on things I truly like. After all, it really is delicious.

"Right then, I think I'll give that a try."

Saying that, Yui-san picked up the tea I'd recommended without hesitation.

"Come to think of it, do you have a teapot at home?"

I was sure Yui-san didn't have one four years ago, but perhaps she'd bought one while I was away? As I asked, Yui-san shook her head from side to side.

"No, I don't. Can I buy one here?"

"They do sell them... but they're rather pricey, aren't they? I've always thought the tea sets here were lovely and fancied getting one someday, but they're just out of my price range..."

Even a simple cup and saucer set costs nearly thirty thousand yen, so adding a pot to the set would make it outrageously expensive. For me, in my second year as a working adult, it was a price point that took a bit of courage to justify.

"I see. Well then, I'll buy one for you too."

　Eh? I gasped, turning to look at Yui-san. But she’d already left me standing there and was striding purposefully towards the shelves displaying the tableware. I hurried after her.

Picking up a small teapot adorned with a camellia design from the shelf, Yui-san smiled contentedly. "It really is lovely, isn’t it?"

　Wait, Yui-san, please check the price tag properly — I started to say, then thought better of it.

That's right, Yui-san doesn't have the sense that "tens of thousands of yen" is expensive.\
Yui-san fundamentally doesn't buy unnecessary things. Her home is always neatly organised, simple, and contains few possessions.

Precisely because of that, she doesn't spare any expense at all for things she wants, things she's decided to buy.

That was the kind of person Yui-san was.

"Since we're at it, let's get matching ones."

Seeing Yui-san say this with a beaming, delighted smile somehow made the tension drain from my shoulders.

I found her offer of matching items genuinely pleasing. Every time I brewed tea at home, I'd surely think of Yui-san.\
That might be rather nice, I found myself thinking, warming to the idea.

"In that case... I'll pay for my own."

Matching sets are charming, but I always feel awkward asking Yui-san to pay for everything. When I said so, she shook her head.

"It's fine. This is to thank you for choosing the tea today."

It seemed far too expensive for a thank-you gift... Even as I thought this, Yui-san absolutely refused to let me take out my purse. In the end, I gave in and acquired the tea set I'd long admired.

"...Thank you. I've wanted this for ages, so I'm really happy."

After settling the bill and expressing my gratitude, she gazed at me with gently narrowed eyes.

"Is there anything else you want? It's a special date, so I'll buy you anything."

It was unfair how she said it, spoiling me like that. If only I could easily tell her what I truly wanted right now, but that was something money could never buy.

"...Your habit of spoiling me hasn't changed, has it? It makes me a bit worried."

I don't know how much Yui-san earns, but even so, isn't she spoiling me a bit too much?

"That's nothing new, is it? It's only because it's you, Kanata. Don't worry about it."

It had better be. I wouldn't like it if Yui-san wasn't kind only to me. I wouldn't like it if she didn't think only of me. I absolutely couldn't forgive her if even a millimetre of that heart leaned towards another girl.

I gently took Yui-san's free hand, the one not carrying her bag, and held it. Yui-san looked slightly startled, her eyes widening a little.

"...Then, please buy me some cute loungewear. I'll keep it at your place."

　Snuggling close to her arm and saying it in a pleading tone, Yui-san squeezed my hand back tightly and smiled happily, "Yes, that's fine."

I'd said just one would be enough, but before I knew it, Yui-san had bought two. They weren't cheap at all, but she said, "Because I want to see Kanata wearing them," looking genuinely delighted. When she says things like that, all I can do is nod.

　I'm weak for Yui-san's smile like that. From her gaze, I can tell she truly cares about me. That's why it makes me happy. I end up thinking I must be special to her, the only one.

By the time one of Yui-san's hands was full of paper bags, it had grown completely dark around us.

After stowing the shopping in the boot, I got into the car. Suddenly, I remembered Yui-san had mentioned wanting a drink today.

"...Come to think of it, didn't you say you fancied a drink?"

I felt a twinge of guilt, wondering if it was my request to change that had forced her to drive.

　As the engine started, a cold wind blew through, pushing aside the lukewarm air and brushing my cheek.

"Another time is fine. Two days in a row is a bit much... I might not be able to hold back either."

Holding back what, I wondered. Tilting my head, Yui-san laughed awkwardly, saying, "Nothing."

　After being treated to dinner, the car headed towards my flat.

I wanted to stay with her longer. I didn't want to go home. I couldn't help feeling that way, and I kept thinking the strangest thing – that it would be great if every single traffic light along the way turned red.

"Next time, come over and teach me how to make proper tea."

"When you're not busy, you go back to that house, don't you?"

"Yes."

The house where I lived with Yui-san for a little over a year. I wanted to go back there again. Maybe even Seal-kun, the seal I’d given custody of to Yui-san, was still there.

"...Will summer be busier than now?"

"Probably busier than spring. We’ve got a new opening coming up too."

Unlike me, Yui-san, being a business owner, was busy. She travels a lot for work, and while I'm incredibly grateful she makes time for me during her precious holidays... I can't help feeling terribly sorry.

"...So we won't be able to meet up so easily like this anymore, then."

I want to be the kind of woman who doesn't make a fuss, who's easy to get along with, but my heart won't let me. When I said it in a sulky tone, Yui-san just laughed and shook her head.

"Not at all. I can always make time. It's not like I work twenty-four hours a day."

"...Really? Aren't you pushing yourself too hard?"

"Honestly. Besides, I've been thinking about hiring a secretary from summer onwards. That should lighten the load a bit. I reckon I've reached my limit doing everything alone."

"I see..."

A secretary, huh. Hearing that, a slight ache stirred deep in my chest. Trying not to show it, I gazed out the window.

A woman, I suppose. I hope she's not a beauty. After all, she'll be spending a lot of time with Yui-san. She might even have to accompany her on business trips? What if she's the sort of woman Yui-san fancies, and she ended up developing feelings for her by any chance...

Thinking it through that far, I reconsidered. This sort of thing... probably isn't good. It's work, after all – feeling jealous or anything like that.

　The final traffic light on the way to the apartment turned red, and the car slowed to a stop. In the quiet cabin, Yui-san spoke as if suddenly remembering.

"Kanata, is there anywhere you'd like to go?"

Yui-san, who probably didn't suspect for a moment that I was jealous of her secretary, whom I hadn't even met yet, looked at me with gentle eyes and said that.

　Places I wanted to go? There were plenty. Too many, in fact.\
I thought for just a moment, then looked straight into Yui-san's eyes and said the place I most wanted to go right now.

"...The aquarium."

"The aquarium? Still fond of it, aren't you?"

Back when we were students, we only spent one summer together. But I still remember it vividly. Going to see the killer whales. The scent of that summer. The taste of seawater splashed over my head. I remember every single detail. Because it was truly wonderful.

"Once work settles down... please take me there."

"Yeah, sure. I promise."

The traffic light turned green. We'd be at my place soon. Though reluctant to part, we'd made another promise. That alone felt enough for now.

The car pulled up beside the apartment block. Trying my best not to let her see how much I didn't want to go home, I quietly unbuckled my seatbelt.

"Thank you for today."

"No, thank you. I had a really lovely time today."

After saying that and smiling, Yui-san unbuckled her seatbelt too.

"I'll get your things."

Stepping out of the car, Yui-san took a tea set and a paper bag containing loungewear from the boot and handed them to me.

"Thank you."

"I'll leave another set at home, so feel free to come and stay anytime."

Saying this, Yui-san smiled, then reached out and gently stroked my cheek affectionately.\
Just this slight touch made my heart beat faster, thumping away in an amusing way.

What is Yui-san thinking right now? I... don't want to go home. I want to stay with her longer. That's what I'm thinking.\
I swallowed hard, holding back the words threatening to spill from my lips, and nodded. Yui-san lowered the outer corners of her eyebrows and gave a soft smile.

"...Kanata, why are you so adorable? I don't want to let you go. Why don't you stay over again tonight?"

"Eh..."

I felt Yui-san's gaze fixed on my lips, and my heart skipped a beat despite myself.\
Back in our school days, Yui-san would probably have kissed me without hesitation.\
But now — those gentle dark eyes just look at me, never daring to touch.

　Yet those lips kept saying things that made me think. Hearing that made me hope. That she still liked me.

But if that’s the case, why won’t she just say so? Back then, Yui-san always told me she liked me.

The Yui-san of now is being mean.

Seeing me at a loss for words, Yui-san smiled, then her hand slipped away effortlessly.

"...Sorry, sorry, just kidding. Don't look so troubled."

If only I could say I don't want to go home either. She knows my personality well enough to know I can't say it, so why doesn't she just take my hand and lead me away like this? I hate myself for not being able to be honest.

"...Good night, Kanata."

"...Good night, Yui."

Unable to voice how much longer I wanted to stay, I reluctantly made my way towards the apartment.\
Turning just before the door, Yui was still outside the car, watching me. She waved with a smile, so I waved back the same way.

　Even after that whirlwind spring ended, I still liked you just as much. Since we met again, that feeling has grown stronger and stronger, to the point it could overflow at any moment.

Summer is coming again. That second summer I couldn't welcome back then – this time, I want to spend it by your side.

Please, I hope you feel the same way I do.

For now, praying like that was all I could do.
