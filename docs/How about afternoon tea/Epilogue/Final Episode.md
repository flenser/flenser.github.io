Final Episode: Say you love me

Then, hand in hand, we walked barefoot along the sandy shore, following the ebb and flow of the waves.

The fine grains of sand were pure white, clinging not to our feet, making it feel as though we were walking on a smooth carpet.

In the distance, a large white bird with a long neck could be seen flapping its wings as it flew away.

　How marvellous. That such a beautiful place existed on this Earth.

"...I hope the stars look beautiful tonight."

Yui-san murmured softly, gazing up at the clear blue sky.

"It's so clear, they're bound to be stunning. When night falls, shall we lie on the sand and do some stargazing?"

"Yes, that sounds lovely. I'm looking forward to tonight too."

　After thoroughly enjoying the sandy shore, we returned to the villa and stretched out on the poolside beach beds.\
Gazing at the horizon stretching endlessly before us, we felt the soft breeze envelop our bodies.

Glancing over, I saw Yui-san notice my gaze and return it with a smile.

"What is it? You're staring."

Ah, this feels so good.\
　We can keep spending time like this from now on. The two of us, forever.

Yui-san shows me sights I could never see alone.\
I'm sure we could go anywhere in this world. Together.

"...Nothing, really. I just thought how happy I am. Thinking about how we can go all sorts of places together from now on."

"That's true. But I'm happy wherever I am, as long as Kanata's with me."

　Saying that, Yui-san gave me a bright smile. As ever, she offered such sweet words without a hint of embarrassment.

"Oh, come on, Yui-san, you always say things like that..."

"Ah, are you blushing?"

"I'm not blushing!"

I turned away abruptly, as if to hide my flushed face. Then Yui-san laughed, took my hand, and pulled me along.

"Come on, Kanata. Let's go in the pool while we're here. I'll put sunscreen on you."

We'd splashed out on expensive sunscreen, figuring the sun would be stronger than in Japan. We decided to help each other apply it to the hard-to-reach spots.

As my palm slid over Yui-san's beautiful white back, I started feeling strangely unsettled.\
　I traced the slightly protruding shoulder blades and followed the curve of her spine. I was always the one being hugged by Yui-san, so I'd never really looked at her back like this before.

Wisely resisting the urge to press my lips against her fine, white skin, I deliberately reached around to her side to cover it up. Yui-san laughed, saying it tickled.

　Yui-san returned the favour by applying sunscreen to me, but I was startled when the touch of her fingers on my back sent a shiver through my body.

Yui-san surely didn't mean it that way, but somehow my body seems to have developed a function that converts every sensation she gives me into that kind of feeling.

"Hey, Yui-san, I can't take it anymore! It tickles...!"

"Eh? But Kanata, you're so fair-skinned, it'd be terrible if you got sunburnt, wouldn't it? Just bear with it until I've applied it everywhere properly."

"No way! I can't do it!"

My face flushed bright red, my body writhing and twitching as I trembled. Yui-san laughed and hugged me tightly.

　After changing into the frilly white swimsuit Yui-san had picked out for me, she beamed with delight the moment she saw me in it. Calling me adorable over and over, she kissed me repeatedly.

Yui-san had chosen a navy blue swimsuit, which suited her perfectly — her long limbs and slender frame looking absolutely stunning in it.

My gaze was drawn to her toned, white abdomen. Perhaps because Yui occasionally went to the gym to work out, her body was always supple and beautiful.

Sitting on the edge of the pool, gazing at the emerald green sea and the large clouds floating in the sky, I moved my feet as if stirring the water, and the coolness felt wonderful.\
Yui sat down beside me and dipped her toes into the pool in the same way.

"...When I go back to Japan, I think I'll go to the gym with you, Yui-san."

"The gym? You don't need it, Kanata. You can eat loads without putting on weight."

"I want a beautiful stomach like yours, Yui-san."

I poked Yui-san's perfectly toned stomach and felt firm muscles beneath a layer of softness.

　Then Yui reached out and gently stroked my slightly softer stomach.

"I like your tummy, Kanata."

"...Isn't it a bit soft? Should I do sit-ups or something?"

"Not at all. This is just right. Besides..."

Peering at my face, Yui grinned. I had a bad feeling about this.

"When you're feeling good, you tense your stomach, don't you? So I reckon that exercise is plenty."

I shoved Yui's shoulder hard, sending her crashing into the pool.\
Splash! Water sprayed everywhere.

"You're such a pervert, Yui!"

　Though the pool wasn't deep, Yui-san was drenched from head to toe after being pushed in. She surfaced, brushed her hair back, and laughed, "Ahaha!"

Before sunset, we headed to the pier where a small sightseeing boat for the sunset cruise was moored and boarded.

The sightseeing boat cut through the wind, moving across the sea.

　Using the ladder, I climbed up to the deck with the best view, gripped the railing, and looked straight ahead.\
Feeling the sea breeze directly on my cheeks, it felt as though I were flying through the sky.

The light of the sinking sun made the boundary between the clouds and the sky glow orange.\
I looked beside me. Seeing her squinting, dazzled, I thought she was more beautiful than anyone else in the world.

　This tenderness felt akin to heartache.\
Just seeing Yui-san's smile made my chest tighten painfully.

As if remembering something, I took the camera hanging from my neck and peered through the viewfinder.

Driven solely by the desire to capture this overwhelmingly happy moment, I pressed the shutter again and again.

　Then, as the sunset melted into the horizon, painting the sea orange.

"Ah! Yui-san, look, dolphins!"

"Wow, really!"

A pod of five or six dolphins appeared in the sunset-tinged sea. Their supple dorsal fins surfaced and submerged repeatedly, and I was utterly captivated by the sight.

"Amazing... It's like a BBC documentary."

"What's that?"

I smiled at Yui, who tilted her head.\
Right, Yui only watches films, doesn't she? I reflected that my comment was a bit niche.

"...Let's watch one together sometime. You should be able to stream them in Japan too."

　We stood shoulder to shoulder, watching until the pod disappeared from view, as if etching their image into our eyes.

By the time the boat returned to the island, night had fallen completely. After enjoying dinner at a seaside restaurant, we walked hand in hand towards the sandy shore.

Sitting down on the beach where only the gentle sound of waves echoed, I gently rested my head on Yui-san's shoulder.

Looking up at the deep indigo sky — a starry expanse more beautiful than any planetarium I'd ever seen stretched out before us.

Fingers intertwined. The deserted night sea. Such a comforting moment existed here that I might have believed it if told we were the only two people left in the world.

"...Hey, Yui-san."

"What is it?"

"The stars are beautiful, aren't they?"

"...Yes, they are. I never imagined stars seen in the middle of the sea could be this beautiful."

"Thank you for bringing me to such a wonderful place. It truly feels like a dream."

"If it's what you wish, I'll take you anywhere. Let's keep making lots of memories together from now on."

Her eyes, black as the night sea, gazed at me tenderly. My chest tightened so much with tenderness it felt like it might burst, making it hard to breathe.

　Long ago, when I asked Yui-san why she never had a lover, she said, "No matter how much I love someone, there are things I could never give them."

She meant she couldn't offer the future most heterosexual couples take for granted: marriage and children.

For her, constantly pressured by those around her, even if those words were spoken without malice, they must have felt like an enormous, insurmountable wall.

　But in the future I envisioned, there was always only you. I never desired anything more.

Just standing here side by side, shoulders touching, my heart feels warm as if bathed in sunlight, filled with certain happiness.

That was everything. Falling in love with you, experiencing so much, the answer I found lies here.

　Love possesses the strength to overcome any hardship.\
As long as we love each other wholeheartedly and sincerely, nothing will ever be lacking.

In a world that unconsciously imposes rigid notions of correctness, we've run this far, envisioning the certain form of happiness we desire.

"...Yui-san, you grant my wishes as if by magic. I always wish I had something to give back to you in return."

As I said this, she squeezed my left hand tightly.

"...Hey, Kanata. In that case, would you grant me just one wish?"

It was rare for the selfless Yui to ask me for anything.\
Overjoyed, I lifted my face, met her eyes, and smiled.

"A wish? Of course. Tell me anything. I'll make it happen for you."

I answered, chest puffed out. If it was something Yui-san wished for, I wanted to make it happen with every fibre of my being. Just as you always do for me.

"Really? Promise you won't refuse, absolutely?"

"Absolutely. Leave it to me."

Facing me directly, Yui-san smiled happily.

"...All right. Now, close your eyes."

"Eh? My eyes?"

"Quickly. Don't open them until I say it's alright."

She gently covered my eyes with one hand, and I closed them as she urged me.\
In the darkness, I felt Yui-san take my left hand. I felt a soft, gentle touch on my ring finger, and then her lips pressed against mine.

　I laughed, saying it tickled, and next, I felt a hard sensation on my ring finger.

Even though I was told not to open them until I was told it was okay — I was startled and opened my eyes without meaning to.

The moment I caught sight of it, lifted up to the base of my finger, I was momentarily speechless.

A ring set with a diamond that reflects faint light in seven colours now adorns my ring finger.

"Yui... this..."

"...Kanata."

Hearing my name, I lifted my face. Eyes like a calm night sea—gazing at me earnestly.

"...I love you."

Riding the soothing sound of waves lapping and receding, those words reached straight into my heart.

Hundreds of times before, she had given me the words "I like you".\
But "I love you" this was the first time she had said it.

My heartbeat quickened. A stinging sensation in the back of my eyes made my vision blur instantly, and tears simply streamed down my cheeks.

　—I love you.

The words echoed repeatedly within my mind.

This was no jest, nor the playful banter between lovers. Right now, she was trying to tell me, with all her heart, that she truly loved me.

I hadn't realised the words 'I love you' could hold such profound depth.

Yui's palm gently stroked my cheek, wiping away my tears.

"I swear I'll love only you for the rest of my life. So swear it too. Tell me... you love me."

Between us lay countless obstacles to overcome. It was never an easy path, nor was it a pretty, picture-perfect romance like in the movies.

Yet we simply loved each other as our hearts cried out, clinging desperately to one another.

　Recalling those days, emotions swirled like a muddy torrent — a fervent longing welled up that words could never convey.\
Reaching out, I held her body tightly. She embraced me back so fiercely it took my breath away, and I desperately wiped away the tears spilling over.

I wanted to tell her with a smile. Just as she had done for me.\
I loosened my arms and gazed at her beloved face.\
　Her dark eyes, like a calm night sea, gazed straight back at me.

"I love you too, Yui-san. I swear I will love only you for the rest of my life."

"Kanata... marry me. Even if we can't register it now, the day will surely come when we can. So please, stay by my side forever."

　Nodding firmly at her words, Yui smiled, genuinely happy.

I believe that day will surely come someday. No matter how long it takes. We can walk together, staying close, wherever we go. Until death do us part.

"...Let's have a wedding ceremony. I want Kanata to wear a beautiful dress."

"Then I'll choose the dress that suits you best, Yui-san."

I imagined my beloved lover clad in a pure white gown. And beside her would be none other than me.

Hand in hand, we'll pledge this love to God. Even if this love isn't yet accepted by everyone.

We'll live with our heads held high.

　Drawing closer, our lips meet in a kiss that barely touches. ――On that deserted night sea, just the two of us, we pledged our certain love.

We met like a miracle, drew to each other, and fell in love so deeply it took our breath away.

Even when we hurt each other, even when we were apart, the memory of each other was etched more strongly than anything in our hearts, and our love burned on, never fading.

　Not only in happy times, but even in times unbearably painful and bitter, even if there were nights we hurt each other, still I want to be by your side.

Until this heart stops beating, I swear I will love you always, no matter what.

Indeed, in this very moment — we have gained eternity.

"…Hey, Kanata. I want you to say you love me one more time."

"Wh-why? I already said it properly just now, didn't I?"

"Once isn't enough! I'd say it ten thousand times over, that I love you, Kanata. So you say it too. Say you love me."

"…Oh, for heaven's sake. Fine then. Just lend me your ear for a moment. I'm too embarrassed to say it out loud."

"Right."

"...Listen, Yui-san. Unlike you, I'm not very good with words, so it might not come across clearly... but I truly do love you, Yui-san."
