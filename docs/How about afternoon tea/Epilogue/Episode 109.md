Episode 109: Shall We Take a Photo Together?

"Hey, Kanata, are you really taking this?"

Peering into my suitcase as I spread out my belongings in one corner of the living room, busy packing away, Yui-san seemed to notice Shachi-kun, squashed flat inside a compression bag. She poked him with her index finger and said discontentedly.

"Yui, I've told you before, please don't call Shachi-kun 'this'. I'd like to show him the beautiful sea while we're at it."

I could guess why Yui looked so displeased.
Knowing I was particularly fond of Shachi-kun among my stuffed toys and had a habit of hugging him to sleep, Yui was unusually keen to keep him away from me.

　Thanks to her, our bedroom now has a "Shachi-kun Entry Ban" in effect. If I even try to bring him in, Yui-san tosses him straight back into the living room, like she's expelling an intruder from her territory.

So this time too, I'm sure she's jealous that I'm trying to take Shachi-kun with me.

　Getting jealous over a stuffed toy? Yui-san has quite the adorable side to her, doesn't she?

"...It's fine going there, but you can't compress it on the way back, can you? Stuffed toys take up space, won't it mean souvenirs won't fit in your suitcase?"

"That's because I'll put it in Yui-san's suitcase, so it'll be fine."

When I stated it so decisively, Yui-san laughed, looking exasperated.

　Into the suitcase went a squashed Orca-kun, several summer outfits, sunglasses, plus a swimsuit, marine shoes, and a rash guard – couldn't forget that.
Splurged on the sunscreen, choosing the priciest one. Should be all covered now.

Just looking at the luggage, it seemed like a midsummer trip.

And rightly so. After all, starting tomorrow, we weren't heading anywhere within Japan.

　We were leaving Japan tomorrow.
We planned to stay at a hotel near Narita Airport tonight. We would take the first flight the next morning and change planes in Sri Lanka.
The destination for this trip was the Maldives, a beautiful resort island surrounded by emerald green waters in the Indian Ocean.

　The Maldives is an island nation with a thriving tourism industry. It is a tropical country consisting of many beautiful islands, popular as a resort for vacations and honeymoons.

There is a dry season and a rainy season, but fortunately, due to an unexpected delay in our long holiday, we are about to enter the best season.

As each island is an independent resort, we should be able to spend a relaxing time without crowds.
　I'm sure everyone has seen photos of those overwater villas stretching out over the shallow sea.

There are no direct flights from Japan, so a transfer is unavoidable, but thanks to Yui's thoughtful arrangement, I'll be flying first class for the very first time in my life.
For someone who always travels economy, this is bound to be a dreamlike journey.

　I long to see it with my own eyes soon. The white sandy beaches and the coral reef sea where colourful fish swim freely.

How beautiful the starry sky must be when viewed from an island in the middle of the ocean.

I never imagined Yui would remember the promise we made to spend Christmas together, that one time during our student days.

　Back then, that vague vision of the future – I never imagined the day would come when it would become reality.

The events I once dreamt of are becoming reality, one by one.

"Hey, Yui. I hope we get to see a whale shark. If we're lucky, we might even see dolphins, apparently. I'm really looking forward to it."

"Yes, I hope so too."

Once our holiday dates were confirmed, we promptly visited the travel agency.
We pored over brochures, discussing and listing things we wanted to do... it felt just like planning a honeymoon and was great fun.

　Upon learning there was an activity to encounter whale sharks, I simply had to swim with them. We settled on a luxury hotel in South Ari Atoll, one of the many atolls where whale sharks reside year-round.
Closing my favourite large suitcase and locking it, I felt more excited about packing than ever before. Fastening the belt around the suitcase heightened the holiday feeling.

　Packing was complete. I stood up to leave the suitcase by the front door ahead of time.

We were scheduled to depart this afternoon for the hotel in Narita where we’d be staying the night before.

"Kana-ta."

"What is it?"

"Turn this way."

Turning at her call, I was swept into a tight embrace. As I caught her weight, Yui-san rubbed her cheek against my hair and tightened her arms around me.

"Ah, I'm so looking forward to it. Seeing you in a swimsuit, Kanata. You'll be absolutely adorable."

Her lips pressed against my cheek tickled, making me close my eyes.

The fact that what she was looking forward to wasn't the sea or the starry sky, but me in a swimsuit, almost made me laugh.

Last week, we'd gone swimsuit shopping together, doubling as a date.
　I had no idea what would suit me, agonised over it, and ended up letting Yui-san choose for me. She was beaming the whole time, so I vaguely realised she was really looking forward to seeing me in a swimsuit.
But I can't shake the feeling she has ulterior motives. I hope it's just my imagination.

"...Yui-san, are you thinking something naughty? You shouldn't. Even if it is a resort, this isn't exactly a country known for its tolerance of same-sex relationships, you know."

"We'll be alone in the room the whole time, so we can do whatever we want, right? No one will find out."

I already had a pretty good idea what she was thinking, even without asking, given that beaming smile of hers.

"Whatever you want... What exactly do you have in mind? Oh, come on, you're not seriously planning to be all naughty all the time, even on holiday?"

"Eh? No way?"

"...I didn't say I didn't like it. But Yui-san hasn't been holding back much lately. You used to be so much gentler."

"You prefer it gentler? If Kanata asks nicely, I'll do anything for you. Tell me exactly how you want it, if you have any preferences."

"That's not what I meant!"

It's not like I'm complaining about the sex itself. My cheeks grew hot. I know Yui-san understands and is just teasing me...

Right after we moved in together, I learned firsthand just what an astonishing stamina Yui-san possesses.
With such a beautiful face, she looks like she'd have no sexual appetite whatsoever, but that's a huge mistake.

I recall when Ritsu-san once harshly criticised her as a "sex-crazed barbarian".
　Yui-san is certainly not barbaric... but I suppose I could agree with the "sex-crazed" part. It's not entirely wrong, I think.

It was all well and good until we'd sorted out every issue holding us back and finally started our cohabitation as lovers.
But perhaps it was that sense of liberation. Once the restraints came off, Yui-san was simply incredible.

After bathing, I'd be dragged straight to bed with no time to relax, only to wake up the next morning. This went on night after night, and it wasn't just once or twice that I nearly nodded off at work from sheer exhaustion.
Disposing of my bed in my room had backfired. With nowhere to retreat to, I was now a rat in a trap.
　Yui-san told me to get rid of the bed, so I obeyed without a second thought, but knowing Yui-san, I can't help feeling she knew I'd run away from the start and simply pre-empted me.
In the end, I gave up after barely a week and protested to Yui-san in no uncertain terms: "This is interfering with my work."

　When I scolded her, Yui looked disappointedly crestfallen, but since we'll be living together from now on, she'll have to listen to my requests too.

To be honest, I'm actually really happy that she wants me, but that's still a secret from Yui.

A sweet, happy life, different from my student days.

On days I finish work on time, we go home together and cook side by side in the kitchen.
　After dinner, we snuggle up on the sofa, sharing stories of our day or watching films.
Kissing in fleeting moments, naturally expressing our love as it blends into everyday life, then drifting off to sleep in each other's arms.

If this isn't happiness, I don't know what is.

Cherishing these happy days, I want to keep building memories like this, occasionally travelling together.

　What's more, this time we're using our extended holiday for a trip to a resort with that special feel. My heart is so full, I might not sleep tonight.

　＊＊＊

　In the evening, we boarded the Narita Express from Tokyo Station, suitcases in tow, heading for our hotel where we'd stay the night before.
　I'm not very familiar with Narita Airport, as I always used Haneda when visiting family.

　After boarding the train and sitting next to each other, I raised the centre armrest and gently intertwined my fingers with hers.
Perhaps it's because we're constantly clinging to each other, as if we can't get close enough. If we're not touching somewhere, I feel restless.

Yui-san squeezed my intertwined fingers back and smiled happily.

"Come to think of it, didn't Ritsu request any souvenirs this time? She always contacts Kanata instead of me for things like this, doesn't she?"

"Well, this time she didn't ask for anything. Just said, 'Forget souvenirs, just tell me all about it when you get back.' That was it."

When I told them Yui-san and I would be living together again, Ritsu-san and Yuri offered their heartfelt congratulations.

I'm truly grateful to them both for supporting our relationship since our student days.

"Still, since we're here, let's buy some tea from Sri Lanka airport for Ritsu and Yuri."

"Not souvenirs from the Maldives?"

"Well, there aren't really any places to buy souvenirs, are there?"

We're staying at an all-inclusive resort the whole time, and there probably won't be anywhere to shop anyway, so the airport's pretty much our only chance to buy souvenirs.

"True, it's hardly the sort of place for souvenirs."

"But that means we can relax more. Hehe, I'm looking forward to it. It's all thanks to you, Yui-san, that we can travel like this. Thank you so much."

"You're welcome. I'm happy Kanata's enjoying it."

Yui-san smiled happily, looking straight into my eyes. I felt the grip on my hand tighten.

「……Kanata」

「What is it?」

Yui-san brought her lips close to my ear. Wondering what it could be, I leaned in to listen.

「I love you」

She whispered softly, and I blushed in surprise.

「Oh, what are you saying in a place like this…!」

Seeing my flustered reaction, Yui-san laughed teasingly.

"You really don't need to be so embarrassed. Honestly, you're adorable, Kanata."

This is something I only realised after we started dating... but having a lover who expresses affection so richly truly makes your daily happiness incomparable.

Yui-san has always been like this, ever since our student days.

She tells me she loves me directly, in words. But it's not just that. She conveys her affection with her gaze, telling me she likes me with her whole body.

　At first, I couldn't tell if Yui-san's words were genuine or not. I even suspected she might say the same thing to everyone.

But now I understand. There wasn't a single lie in her words.

"I'm so happy I can be with Kanata all the time from today. Lately, I couldn't see Kanata's face while working, and I was struggling because I couldn't get motivated at all."

"Saying things like that, I won't be responsible if your father scolds you, you know?"

"It's all Dad's fault, you know. He's the one who took Kanata away from me. Don't you think that's awful? Making his daughter's girlfriend his secretary?"

With that, Yui let out a deep sigh.

"I'm delighted, actually. Knowing that one day I might be able to assist Yui-san makes me more enthusiastic about my work. President Ichinose is very kind, too."

"I absolutely think I'm kinder than my father..."

Yui-san narrowed her eyes slightly and looked at me with apparent displeasure.
It was true, but thinking back now, I suppose Yui-san really did spoil me too much.

"Now, now, Yui-san, don't sulk like that. Thanks to you, we got to take time off together, didn't we? President Ichinose sent us off quite happily too."

"That may be true, but..."

Had we remained president and secretary, we might never have been able to take a long holiday together and go travelling like this.
Thinking that, I felt there was meaning in us working in separate departments after all.

　I smiled at Yui-san, who was still looking rather sulky, and picked up the camera hanging around my neck, as if to change the subject.

"Actually, Yui-san. How about we take some photos together instead?"

"Photos? Here?"

"Yes. The journey itself is part of the memories."

Saying that, I rested my head on Yui-san's shoulder.

　Stretching my arm to point the lens towards us, I pressed the shutter. A satisfying click echoed.

I want to take lots of photos, so that someday we can look back and talk about these memories.

I savoured the happiness of having Yui beside me in this very moment.

The train sped on, carrying us along.

This trip will surely become a memory I'll never forget.
