Episode 110: Yui, Look This Way

My first experience of first class was a dazzling space that far exceeded my imagination.

Unlike economy, you could stretch your legs, or even lie down.\
I was genuinely moved by this air journey that was almost too comfortable.\
The only drawback, perhaps, was that the seats were so spacious it made the distance between me and Yui-san feel a little greater.

　The aeroplane carrying us was heading for Colombo Airport in Sri Lanka, our stopover en route to our final destination.\
We could have flown via Singapore, but Sri Lanka is famous for its tea, so I'd always wanted to visit.\
I'd already decided to buy some Ceylon tea at the airport on the way back.

　The nine-hour flight was comfortable. Having endured half-day journeys in economy class every time I returned to London, I thoroughly enjoyed the spaciousness of first class.

Yui-san, however, seemed unaccustomed to such long journeys and was utterly exhausted by the time we arrived in Sri Lanka.

　Sad news for the utterly exhausted Yui, but to reach the Maldives, we needed to transfer here to another flight bound for Male, the Maldivian capital.

We planned to stay there overnight today – then take a seaplane the next day to the resort on South Ari Atoll where we would be staying.

　The Maldives International Airport, where we landed for the first time, had a strange, exotic scent that I had never experienced before.

It was night when we arrived, so it was a shame we couldn't see the sea from the plane window, but tomorrow we would surely see the vivid emerald green sea.

As soon as we arrived at the airport, I was surprised by the heat.\
Coming from winter in Japan, the temperature exceeding thirty degrees was quite unbearable.\
　We quickly shed our jackets and were down to short sleeves, but we couldn't adjust to the temperature difference immediately and boarded the car heading for the hotel, wiping away the sweat pouring off us.\
By the time we'd checked into the hotel and reached the air-conditioned room, we were both drenched in sweat.

"Phew... It's not humid, but it's still hot, isn't it?"

Yui-san placed her suitcase on the luggage rack and stretched her body. Her toned abs peeked out from beneath her white shirt, and I hastily averted my gaze.

"Well, it is a tropical country, after all."

Diving onto the bed drenched in sweat wasn't an option, so I sat down on the sofa, grabbed the collar of my shirt, and flapped it to let the cool air inside.

"I really need to freshen up. Oh, Kanata, you go ahead and take a shower first."

"Aren't you more tired, Yui-san? It's fine, I'll go later."

I'm used to long journeys, but Yui-san isn't, so she must be exhausted.\
She always puts me first, but at times like this, I wanted to let her go first, so I suggested it.

Then Yui-san seemed to ponder for a moment before clapping her hands as if struck by inspiration.

"Hmm... Well then, since we're here, let's have a shower together."

"Eh? Yui-san, you're not planning anything strange, are you? You must be exhausted from travelling today, surely...?"

I reckon she's fine, but just to be safe. Better to confirm her intentions. I gave her a suspicious, lingering look.

"If it's what Kanata desires, then no matter how tired I am, I'm always ready for you."

Yui peered into my eyes and grinned. I couldn't tell if she was joking or serious, so to protect myself from her, I hastily pushed her shoulder away — but in the end, she overpowered me, and we ended up showering together.

　As we splashed about under the showerhead mounted on the wall, its water pressure not particularly strong, her mischievous palm predictably tried to touch my body. I smacked the back of her hand sharply and glared at her, causing Yui to pout and sulk.

We hadn't even reached our destination yet, and keeping up with Yui was draining my energy.

　That night, I managed to escape Yui's clutches, and we massaged each other to relieve the fatigue of travelling, then fell asleep in each other's arms.

　Then the next day.

Early in the morning, we headed to the seaplane airport, enjoyed a light meal in the lounge, and then followed the staff to the boarding area.

Above the emerald green sea, several small seaplanes floated along the wooden pier.

　Seaplanes can take off and land anywhere there is sea, even without a runway, making them a useful means of transport in countries surrounded by water.\
The aircraft, with its propeller-equipped wings and gleaming white body adorned with red lines, had floats attached underneath, allowing it to float gracefully on the crystal-clear surface of the water.

It was a tiny little plane, with a capacity of less than twenty people.

"Wow, this is my first time on such a tiny plane. I wonder how high this propeller can take us?"

"Yes, it is. This is my first time on a small plane too."

It felt less like a mode of transport and more like an amusement park ride.

Perhaps unable to withstand the sunlight stinging her eyes, Yui-san slipped on the sunglasses she'd hooked onto her shirt collar.

　The sight was so picturesque that, before putting on the sunglasses I'd bought for this very day for the first time in my life, I peered through the viewfinder of the camera hanging around my neck and snapped a shot of the seaplane and Yui-san.

Once aboard the plane, the cockpit was right in front of us, being such a small aircraft.\
I stared intently as the pilot, wearing teardrop-shaped black sunglasses, operated unfamiliar switches with practised ease.

　When the engine roared to life, I pressed the small earplugs I'd been given firmly into my ears and gazed out of the window as if I were biting into it.

The propellers on both wings began to spin round and round.

　The aircraft pulled away from the jetty and headed out to sea. Gaining speed rapidly, the seaplane glided across the emerald green water.

Just as I felt the sensation of being pulled away from the surface, the plane lifted off in an instant.\
I looked down from the plane window at the townscape of Male and the sea. The aircraft headed for the resort island where we were staying, raising its nose as if heading for the sky.

　I think we were only in the air for a few tens of minutes. Gliding smoothly across the water's surface, the plane touched down and taxied alongside a large raft-like structure floating in the sea.\
Right next to it, moored, was a small boat, presumably the means of transport for getting ashore on the island.\
Visible to the naked eye, just there, was an island with water villas strung along the coast.

　It seemed this was a sort of stopover point.\
Not all passengers disembarked; the plane appeared to be heading for the next island with some passengers on board.

Before boarding the small boat, we exchanged greetings with the male concierge assigned to us.\
There were no staff who spoke Japanese, but as the official language across the entire island was English, it posed no problem.

"Kanata, what did he just say?"

Yui whispered the question in my ear.

"He's our assigned concierge. He said he'd explain everything properly once we reached the island."

　I could be useful to Yui here. I proudly volunteered to interpret.

We disembarked from the small boat and stepped onto the long wooden pier of the resort island.

The horizon stretched endlessly, and white clouds floated in the cobalt blue sky. The emerald green sea was so beautiful that it was easy to lose sight of the boundary between sky and sea, sparkling as it reflected the sunlight.

　It was unlike any sea I had ever seen before. The waves were calm, and the seawater was as clear as fresh water, yet I could smell the sea, which I found strangely fascinating.

The concierge who was guiding us to the lobby pointed under the pier and said, "There's a shark."

　Surprised, I peered down and saw a small shark, about thirty centimetres long, swimming and wriggling its body from side to side.

"Wow, Yui, look, a shark!"

"Eh, a shark!?"

Even a small shark is impressive when seen up close.

"It's amazing sharks are this close."

"Apparently the Maldives has all sorts of shark species. It said so in the brochure."

"Eh, they won't attack us?"

"They say the sharks in the house reef don't usually attack people. Further out to sea, though, there seem to be larger sharks like tiger sharks and hammerheads."

"Oh... well... as long as we don't run into them..."

Yui gave a nervous, wry smile, and I couldn't help but laugh.

Reaching the sandy beach from the jetty, I was astonished by the fineness of the sand grains. Far finer than Okinawa's sand. The pure white sand looked almost like powdered snow.

　Palm fronds, growing skyward along the island's contours, rustled pleasantly in the sea breeze reaching from beyond the ocean.

After enjoying welcome drinks and receiving a briefing in the lobby, we walked along the long, gently curving jetty towards the overwater villa where we'd be staying from today.

　A soft sea breeze ruffled Yui-san's long black hair as she walked ahead of me. Her white shirt stood out beautifully against the blue sky, and I found myself savouring the thought: ah, how lovely.\
It was as if she'd stepped straight out of a painting.

"Hey, Yui-san, turn this way."

"Hmm?"

I stopped and peered through the camera's viewfinder, pressing the shutter the instant Yui-san turned around.

　The camera I'd been given for my birthday, I'd carried with me everywhere I went to this day, taking countless photographs. Thanks to that, it now felt completely natural in my hands.

"...Hehe, it came out beautifully."

"Somehow... I've started wanting a camera myself. Lend it to me later, okay? I'll take loads of photos of you too."

"That's fine, I'll lend it to you specially. Let's take loads of photos, shall we? ... Oh, right! Why not ask Father Christmas for matching cameras for both of us this Christmas?"

"Eh? That's no good. Father Christmas would go bankrupt."

"It'll be fine! Father Christmas has a wealthy lover, so even if he buys something a bit pricey, he won't end up struggling financially."

"That might be true, but still—"

As we spoke, we arrived at the villa where we would be staying.\
Yui inserted the key and slowly pushed open the white wooden door.

　What met our eyes was a room with an uninterrupted ocean view.\
The air-conditioned interior was comfortable. Beneath a ceiling fan mounted on the high ceiling stood a large bed. Two towel art swans, modelled after real birds, sat side by side on the bed, welcoming us.

　Opening the glass doors facing the sea revealed a terrace with a private pool and two beach beds, plus a ladder leading directly from the room down to the water.\
What an utterly splendid room. Far more impressive than it had appeared in the brochure.\
The bathroom also offered sweeping sea views, and the shower room floor was glass-tiled – peering down, we saw yellow fish gliding smoothly beneath our feet.

"Hey, Yui, isn't this incredible?! We're literally above the sea. Staying in such a wonderful place for days feels like a dream."

My excitement was unstoppable. Camera in hand, I was darting around the room exploring when suddenly, my hand was grabbed and I was pulled towards someone with all their might.\
Before I knew it, I was being hugged, then tangled up and pushed down onto the bed.

"Whoa! You... you scared me!"

　I hadn't expected to be pinned down so soon after arriving, so I looked up at Yui-san in surprise.\
We hadn't even unpacked our suitcases yet. What on earth had come over her?

"Wh-what's wrong?"

"...You looked so cute, getting all excited, I just wanted to hold you. I'm so happy you're enjoying this."

Saying that, Yui-san hugged me tightly and gave me a gentle kiss.

"You suddenly pushed me down, so I thought you were going to do something strange..."

"Eh? Is that okay?"

"No way! What are you talking about?! We've only just arrived..."

"Sorry, sorry, just kidding."

Saying that, Yui-san kissed my forehead soothingly... but was she really joking? Somehow, it felt like she was a bit serious.

"Yui-san, once we've sorted our luggage, shall we go explore the beach?"

"Sounds good, let's do that."

Opening the suitcase, I first took out Shachi-kun, who'd been transported completely flattened like a rice cracker.\
Opening the compression bag and sucking out the air, he returned to his original size.

Shaping him with both hands, I gently placed him on the bed so Shachi-kun could see the sea too.

　Shachi-kun had been my steadfast companion during the four years apart from Yui-san.\
I felt truly grateful to have brought him all this way.

"Kanata?"

"Yes?"

Turning at the sudden call, I saw Yui-san grab Shachi-kun firmly with one hand and lift him up.

"Ah! What are you doing?!"

"Have you forgotten? No, not on the bed."

Saying that, Yui-san placed Shachi-kun back on the sofa.

"Ugh, why are you being so mean...!"

"Well, Kanata, you always try to sleep hugging that thing even though I'm here."

It was true. I recalled several times when, while Yui-san hugged me from behind, I'd tried to sleep hugging Shachi-kun instead, only to upset her by saying, "It makes me feel lonely when you keep turning your back on me."

"Kanata. If you want to hug someone, hug me."

So Yui-san and Shachi-kun had fallen out properly... Was it my fault after all?

Feeling a little remorseful, I hugged Yui-san tightly against my chest, my apology in my embrace.

"I'm sorry. But... please don't treat Shachi-kun too roughly, alright?"

"Only if Kanata prioritises me over Shachi-kun."

Saying that, Yui-san gently pressed her lips to my cheek.

With no other choice, I decided Shachi-kun's permanent spot in this room would be on the sofa, just as Yui-san said.
