Episode 1: The Person Called Ichinose Yui

The red scar on her shoulder, visible through the neckline of her loungewear T-shirt, stood out starkly against her pale skin.

It took only a few moments to realise that scar was someone's teeth marks.

　Leaning back against the sofa, Yui-san was engrossed in the film playing on the large screen. I crept up behind her and peered over the sofa to look at the mark.

Blimey, that looks painful. When she left home yesterday, it probably wasn't there.\
So this mark must be from last night. Because Yui-san didn't come home yesterday.

　What on earth does 'sex so good it makes you want to bite' feel like?

Even imagining her night with someone else remained just that – imagination. Yet the only fact left here was that last night, someone had clung to her, sinking their teeth into this white shoulder hard enough to leave a mark.

"Doesn't this hurt?"

"Eh?"

When I gently prodded the red, swollen mark with my fingertip, her hand shot up to cover it.

"...It hurts. Don't touch it."

Her brows drew together slightly, a hint of annoyance. Her long black hair slid smoothly off her shoulder. I met the reproachful gaze of her beautiful face, staring straight back at her.

"But it's terribly swollen. That wound is noticeable."

"It'll fade in a day or two, won't it?"

"It looks painful. How come you don't get angry?"

"It didn't draw blood, so I don't get angry over every little thing. But it hurt like hell, so maybe next time I won't."

Saying this, she gave a mischievous smile.

Yui-san is a woman who likes women – a homosexual, so to speak.

　But the woman who had presumably bitten Yui-san wasn't her lover.

It took less than a month after I started staying with her for me to realise.\
On days Yui-san didn't come home, she'd always be crashing at some woman's place. By dawn, when she left the house, the scent of her perfume that should have lingered had vanished.

At first, I thought she had a boyfriend. I assumed she was staying out because she couldn't invite a boyfriend home with me suddenly staying there.

　Until I saw her kissing a woman at a so-called faculty social gathering.

It wasn't just that she didn't hide being homosexual; she was also a notorious womaniser among the seniors at university.

"You'll get stabbed one day, honestly."

"Oh, come on, enough about me. Here, come over here. Let's watch a film together."

It was always like this. Whenever I tried to broach a sensitive subject, she'd skilfully sidestep it.

　She beckoned me over with a little wave, and when I swung round the sofa and settled down beside Yui-san, she promptly draped a blanket over my knees. That's when I thought, she really is used to women.

She picked up the remote from the coffee table and paused the film.

"Huh? Weren't we going to watch the film?"

"Yeah, you can pick what you want to watch, Kanata. I'll go and get us something to drink."

"Right," I said, taking the remote. Though the film was undoubtedly unfinished, Yui-san didn't seem particularly bothered about the plot continuing. Humming to herself, she headed towards the kitchen.

This house was equipped with a proper surround sound system and projector, the sort you'd find displayed in an electronics shop. And within this house – far too spacious and impersonal for someone living alone – it was the one thing that gave me a sense of Yui-san's "likes".

　That Yui-san loved films was one of the few things I knew about her.

Beyond that, I knew very little else.

She was a third-year at the same university. So two years older than me. Left-handed.\
Preferred coffee over tea, and her drink of choice was a highball.\
Didn't cook, but could manage household chores; her place was spotless, devoid of anything superfluous.

The reason she lives alone in such a splendid single-storey house in Tokyo is that she is the daughter of one of Japan's leading zaibatsu conglomerates.

Yui-san's father is the current president, and surprisingly, he is also a university friend of my father's.\
It was through this connection that the idea of me staying here came about.\
Even listing everything I can think of off the top of my head, I still know next to nothing about her.

　The sound of the hot milk placed on the table before me jolted me back to reality.

"Here you are."

"Thank you."

As I sipped from the mug, the faint scent and sweetness of honey spread through my mouth.

Back in March, when I'd just started staying with her, she made me hot milk every night. I'd returned alone from England, where my family lived, to continue my studies.\
　Back then, she felt like a kind, dependable older sister.\
Honestly, I never imagined she was a homosexual, and on top of that, someone with such a twisted view of love. Thinking this, I glance sideways at Yui-san.

"Decided what you want to watch?"

"...This one, the dog one."

I point at the dog on the screen in the dimly lit room. I thought Yui-san might not like this sort of thing.

　Two months into my lodging. I'd come to understand firsthand just how indulgent she was towards women. She always accommodated my slightest whim.

"You like dogs? Fine, let's watch this one today."

Yui-san took the remote and pressed play.\
At the same time, I tugged the blanket slightly, pulling it up to my shoulders.

"What's the matter? Cold?"

Noticing my reaction, Yui's hand drew me closer, her shoulder pressed against mine. The warmth radiating from her skin felt comforting. Human warmth dispels loneliness.

If she were my girlfriend, she'd surely be even kinder, I thought.

She claims she "doesn't do relationships" – it's just that she isn't interested. What a waste. Being this beautiful, it's no wonder she never lacks suitors.

　For her, perhaps committing to just one person is the real waste.

I don't understand what it feels like to fall for a woman. I've never even imagined it.

The hand that drew me close gently stroked my hair, playing with the ends.

I suppose it's precisely because she does this naturally with everyone that so many women get hooked.

"...Yui-san, you're such an insincere person, so why are you so popular?"

Ahaha, Yui-san laughs. Truthfully, I've long since realised why this person is popular.

It's just that I desperately want to blame this person, who I simply cannot be devoted to.

"Well, I wonder what it is about me?"

　Even though I said it accusingly, she barely seemed to notice, just smiling cheerfully, which left me confused.

Is that normal?

Not being in a relationship, yet spending the night together? Is that how university students are?

"Do you have a boyfriend, Kanata?"

The question came so suddenly I looked at Yui in surprise. Since I started staying with her, I'd never once spent the night away. I thought she must have noticed.

"No. You can tell just by watching me live, can't you..."

"Oh, right. You're so good at getting people to look after you, I thought you must have someone. Long-distance, maybe?"

"...I did back there, but he cheated on me and then dumped me."

Even thinking about it now makes my heart ache, like it's being pricked and scraped. I don't have any lingering feelings, but he left a deep wound that really gouged my heart.

　That incident was one reason I chose a Japanese university, but I still don't have the courage to complain about it to anyone.

"Cheating? Good riddance, then."

"And this is coming from the perpetually unfaithful Yui-san?"

I couldn't help but laugh as I pointed it out. As if Yui-san herself didn't have relationships with all sorts of women.

"In my case, you wouldn't call it cheating, would you? I don't have a girlfriend."

"I don't see the difference. Is there really no one in this world who can love just one person, purely and wholeheartedly, forever?"

I'm glad we chose a heartwarming animal film today. It soothes my frayed nerves.

Dogs are wonderful, aren't they? They love their owners purely and unconditionally. Is it greedy of me to want that kind of devoted love?

　Not that I necessarily want a lover like a dog, mind.

"You're cute, Kanata, so you'd probably get a boyfriend in no time."

"You don't think I'm cute at all... I'm not your type, am I?"

"...Did I say that?"

"You said something close to it. Right when we first moved in together."

　I still remember the words Yui-san said to me, apologetically lowering her eyebrows as if to reason with me, when I panicked upon learning she was a lesbian.

——It’s not like I’d go for any woman indiscriminately, so don’t worry. Sorry for keeping quiet about it.

I know she said it to reassure me, but it also meant I wasn’t included.

　Not that it matters, really. I'm not gay myself, and since I'm staying at Yui's place for the duration of university, it's probably better that way.

I know that, but still... it doesn't feel quite right.

"When we first moved in together, right? Kanata, you were like a cat that hadn't been socialised with people."

The sudden, out-of-the-blue remark made a question mark appear above my head.

"A cat?"

"It took two months before you finally let me touch you, didn't it? You were on high alert at first."

"...It's nothing. I'm just snuggling up because it's cold."

"Shall I turn the heating up then?"

Stared at intently by those dark eyes, I couldn't think of a reply and my gaze drifted.

I know I should pull away. But part of me definitely doesn't want to let go of this warmth.

　Even though I know it. That I'm homesick and lonely.

"...Yui-san, you're being rather mean."

"Am I?"

"Not realising it is the worst..."

"Sorry, sorry. Just joking. I'm just happy Kanata's warming up to me."

Feeling tickled around my throat, knowing she was teasing me, I pulled her hand away and glared at her. Yui-san laughed.

　Like a cloud. Elusive, ethereal, the sort who might vanish before you realise.

But I was utterly captivated by that sweet, comforting hot milk, leaning into her shoulder. Right now, I rather liked nights like this.

Suddenly, as if to interrupt this small moment of relaxation, Yui-san's smartphone, resting on the coffee table, rang.

An unfamiliar woman's name. Yui glanced at it briefly before tapping the mute button.

"Is it alright? Not answering?"

"Hmm, yeah. It's fine for now. I'll call back later if I feel like it."

She flipped her phone over, sounding disinterested, which somehow annoyed me. Wanting to get back at her a little, I felt like being slightly mean.

"Could it be the person who bit you you?"

"No idea, I've forgotten."

"Liar," I said, pinching the arm around my shoulder hard.

A May night. The start of university life, full of anxiety, away from home.

Meeting Yui-san – kind, mean, and a liar – was the beginning of it all.

Back then, I believed without a shred of doubt that these trivial days would surely continue right up until graduation.
