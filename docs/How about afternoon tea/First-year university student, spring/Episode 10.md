Episode 10: How Can I Make It Right?

In this world, there are things one should do and things one shouldn't.

Generally speaking, kissing someone you're not dating without their permission is wrong.

Yesterday, Yui was more drunk than I'd ever seen her before, so I suppose there's some leeway for extenuating circumstances.

It was just one kiss, after all. It's not like it was the first time. Pouring water over her head might have been a bit much, I thought with an unusually clear head come morning.

I woke much earlier than usual. The sensation lingering on my lips still wouldn't fade.

Would Yui greet me with her usual 'Good morning' as if nothing had happened? I didn't know. I couldn't even imagine.

I crawled slowly out of bed and headed for the shower. Before Yui-san woke, I wanted to escape this house, even for a moment.

The door to the master bedroom opened just as I finished packing my Boston bag and was ready to leave the house.

"...Good morning, Kanata..."

Yui-san appeared in the living room, looking hungover and miserable, clutching her forehead. Her eyes widened in surprise. First she looked at me, then her gaze shifted to the Boston bag in my hand.

Compared to yesterday, she looked unusually fresh, so she must have showered after that. Well, of course – she’d had water poured over her head, so she couldn’t possibly have slept like that.

"...What's with that luggage?"

"I'll be staying at a friend's place for a while. Don't worry about me, alright? Well then."

"Eh... Wait a minute, Kanata!"

　I headed straight for the front door, trying to escape the sound of footsteps chasing after me, but she caught up in the hallway and grabbed my hand abruptly.\
Turning around, Yui-san looked slightly troubled.

Honestly, that face is infuriatingly beautiful. It must be that face. All the women in the world spoiled her, and that's why Yui-san turned out like this.

"...Yui-san. Do you remember what you did to me yesterday?"

　If she dared say she didn't remember because she was drunk, I'd slap that cheek of hers. That was my intention as I stared at her.

Yui-san seemed resigned. After a deep breath, she murmured, "I remember." Her voice was barely audible.

"...You're angry, aren't you?"

"...Does it look like I'm not?"

If she asked why I was angry, I couldn't explain it properly yet. I felt I needed time. Time to properly sort out my thoughts.

More than that, I feared that if I faced Yui-san before that, I might hurl words I didn't truly mean. For now, I simply wanted distance. For both of us.

"Sorry, I was terribly drunk yesterday..."

"I'm leaving now. I'll be late."

I abruptly brushed her hand away and bolted out the front door as if fleeing. I thought I heard her say "Wait a moment," but I ignored it all.

　I didn't want to hear the rest of that sentence.

Because I was drunk, anyone would have done.

If she'd said that, this time I might actually have slapped her across the face.

＊＊＊

I'm terribly sorry, but there's only one friend I can think of who I could possibly ask to let me stay over tonight.

The friend I pleaded with, hoping for a yes, agreed more readily than I'd imagined.

　Her name is Yuri Asumi, the one with shoulder-length blonde hair tied back in a single ponytail. My first friend made at university.

Yuri, originally from the countryside, lives alone in a second-floor studio flat in a student-oriented apartment block.

She loves rock music, and the walls of her room – which you couldn't exactly call spacious – are plastered with posters of obscure bands, crammed together as if there wasn't enough room.

After university ended, I barged in unannounced, yet she didn't complain once. She moved the guitar beside the bed out of the way and laid out the futon meant for guests. I sat cross-legged on it.

"Yuri, letting me stay over is a huge help. Thank you so much."

"Well, you can stay as long as you like, but did you run away from home? Did you have a row with your senior or something?"

　She asked with a smirk, poking my Boston bag, making me feel uncomfortable. There was no way I could say it. That I'd run away angry after Yui-san kissed me.

"...Well, sort of."

"I heard Ichinose-senpai was kind, but maybe not? Not your type?"

No, she's kinder than the rumours. Whether we're compatible... honestly, I can't say myself. I find living with Yui-san comfortable, but I don't know how she feels about it.

"She's kind. She is kind... but sometimes I just can't figure out what she's thinking at all."

"Hmm. So, who was at fault in this fight?"

Asked that, I faltered. Yui-san was the one who started it. But me throwing water was over the top too. So, if you ask who was at fault...

"It's complicated..."

"Ahaha, what's that supposed to mean?"

Yuri laughs, completely unfazed. I rather like Yuri for listening properly without prying too deeply.

"Did you get so fed up with her you don't want to live together anymore?"

"It's not like that. It's just... I don't have the mental space to see her right now."

"But the longer you wait, the more awkward it gets, seriously."

"I know, but..."

I know. I know, but I'm stuck because I don't know what face to make.

After that, Yui-san messaged me saying she wanted to talk and asked me to come back, but I ignored it and turned off my phone.

　I'm scared to face her. The longer time passes, the more the waves of anger recede, leaving the real reason I was angry exposed. I was definitely furious. But it wasn't because I was kissed.

I was furious at the sheer insensitivity of her touching me while still carrying the scent of another woman.

Once I understood that, I couldn't bring myself to blame her for the kiss itself anymore.

Because... I didn't mind it. It surprises me, but it's true.

"Don't you want to make up with her?"

"I do... I want to make up."

I hugged my knees tightly. I was fully aware I was acting like a child throwing a tantrum.

Yuri's phone pinged. A message had come from someone, and she was swiftly swiping her finger across the screen.

"I see. Well, I suppose you have things on your mind. Oh, Kanata, go ahead and take a bath first."

"Eh, is that alright?"

"Take your time. It's just come up to the right temperature."

She waved her hand dismissively, so I took her at her word and decided to go ahead and have a bath first.

　Yuri's flat was student-sized, so the bath wasn't particularly large.

I'd grown accustomed to it after living in that house for a while, but it struck me anew just how wealthy Yui-san really was.

You don't often find jet baths in ordinary homes, and this felt like the standard for student accommodation.

I curled up, sinking down until my mouth was submerged. I was the one who'd run away, so why did this feel so strange?

　Right now, I desperately want to see Yui-san.

It's strange. I should still be angry.

"...Cute and not a bother, huh?"

My own voice echoed in the bathroom. Well, I suppose I'm not her type, I thought.

　After drying my hair and stepping out of the changing room, I heard Yuri talking on the phone with someone. I opened the door separating the hallway from the room.

"Ah, you're up?"

"Sorry, were you on the phone?"

"She just arrived, Ichinose-senpai."

"Eh?"

What on earth? I tilted my head in confusion. Then Yūri turned back to the phone, said, "Room 203," and hung up.

"I just got a call from Ichinose-senpai."

"How does Yuri know Yui-san's phone number?"

Eh? She wouldn't say they'd had a relationship, would she? As if reading my thoughts, Yuri smiled.

"Do you know Nakahara Ritsu?"

"I know her. She's Yui-san's friend, but..."

"Well, I just got a message via a club senior. Apparently, the girl sharing a room with Ichinose-senpai was desperately searching for her closest friend, and that's how it came to me."

Ritsu-san, isn't your social circle a bit too wide? I reckon Yui-san, at her wits' end, turned to Ritsu-san for help. I don't know how much she told her, but the fact that Ritsu never contacts me directly in situations like this makes me realise that despite all their bickering, they really are best friends.

As I froze upon hearing Yui was coming, Yuri draped my coat over my shoulders.

"Don't catch a chill. Seeing how desperately she's searching for you, I figured she must really want to make up, so I gave her my address. If you don't want to go home, you can stay over here tonight. What do you reckon?"

My spirit was utterly crushed. I should have been angry, yet I was glad she'd come to fetch me. I know it's contradictory.

"…………I'll go home. Thanks, Yuri."

"Make sure you patch things up properly, alright?"

"……Yeah."

This is my weak spot. No wonder people say I'm a pain.

　The intercom chimed, and Yuri opened the door. Yui-san was standing there.

Even though she must have a hangover, she always looks sharp when she's out and about. She didn't show any sign of tiredness or agitation, just smiled brightly.

"Sorry for the late hour. Pleased to meet you, I'm Ichinose Yui."

"And this is Asumi Yuri, Kanata's friend. Pleased to meet you."

After brief introductions, Yui-san glanced at me, still standing there in my coat. As I hesitated, unable to take a step forward, Yuri gave my back a firm shove towards the entrance.

"...Kanata, let's go home."

She said it gently. I nodded reluctantly, and Yui-san smiled with relief.

"Yuri, sorry for keeping you so late."

"It's fine. See you at uni."

"Right."

Waving goodbye to Yuri, I spotted Yui-san's car parked beside the apartment block. It was instantly recognisable – a shiny black luxury model.

"Kanata, give me your bag."

Saying this, Yui-san took my Boston bag and I followed behind her. She opened the passenger door and urged me in, so I obediently climbed into the car.

Alone with Yui in the car. Surprised, I accepted the warm milk tea she handed me.

"I bought it at the convenience store earlier."

"Thank you..."

This is both Yui's good point and her bad point. This is just how she is, I thought. Why didn't anyone tell her she shouldn't be this kind to anyone but the person she likes?

　Unbeknownst to my thoughts, the car began driving towards my house.

After that, Yui-san didn't speak a single word in the car. I didn't know how to start a conversation either, so I remained silent.

I stole a glance at her profile. She seemed so composed. Even though we were only two years apart, she felt far, far more mature than me.

The journey home felt incredibly long.

"Welcome home."

Entering the living room, I heard those words and, unsure how to respond, lowered my gaze.

I suppose it's no wonder I'm told I look like a borrowed cat now, after dashing out of the house so energetically this morning.

"Sit down," she urged, gesturing towards the sofa. I obediently settled myself, and Yui-san knelt on the floor, taking my hands in hers.

She doesn't run away, yet her earnest eyes stare straight at me, unwavering.

"Kanata. Let me properly apologise for yesterday."

I clasp her warm hand back. I knew I had to apologise to Yui-san too, yet I find myself looking down — it must be because I'm being spoiled by her.

"I'm sorry about the kiss. It must have been disgusting for you to be kissed like that by someone of the same sex."

Eh? Why would you think that? I looked up abruptly, and Yui-san smiled, looking just a little lonely. No, that's not it.

"If you can forgive me, I'd like to keep living together from now on."

"...Yui-san."

I called her name, cutting her off. Don't misunderstand. I squeezed her hand tightly.

"It wasn't that I disliked the kiss. I didn't think it was disgusting."

Yui-san's eyes widened slightly, looking a little surprised.

"...Then what did you dislike?"

Her soft, gentle voice. Just hearing my name spoken in that voice felt like it dragged out the softest part of my heart.

What I disliked? That sort of thing.

"...I don't want to say."

"Eh? I can't understand unless you tell me. I can't apologise either."

Yui-san said, looking troubled.

"It's fine, you don't need to apologise. Yui-san, aren't you angry about me splashing water?"

"Water? I'm not angry. It was my fault."

"...You think it's a bother, don't you?"

"I don't, I don't."

Her gentle smile melted the frozen part of my heart. I should have talked to her from the start instead of running away.

"Hey, Kanata. What would make you forgive me?"

Truthfully, I'd forgiven her ages ago. But since Yui-san was asking like this, I might as well just be honest and let this person spoil me.

"...I felt lonely. Even though we were only apart for a little while. It was all your fault I ran away from home."

When I said that, Yui-san laughed and stood up. She sat down beside me and hugged me tightly.

As I nestled into her chest, I could smell that pure, unadulterated scent that was uniquely hers. I adore this smell so much.

Even though I know I can't have her all to myself, I still wish this embrace could be a place just for me.

"I'm truly sorry. I'll do anything to make it up to you."

"...Anything? Really?"

"Really. Anything."

"...Then, when summer comes, take me to the aquarium. I want to see the killer whales."

As I murmured this, Yui-san hugged me tightly and laughed.

"The aquarium? Don't you want to go with Hayakawa-kun?"

　Why bring Hayakawa-kun into this now? She's so mean.

"It's fine. Yui-san promised to take me."

"Alright, fine. I promise."

She gently took my hand and intertwined our little fingers. I could only laugh for now. The Bōsō Peninsula is quite a distance, after all.

A proper summer was about to arrive. I had a feeling our relationship might change just a little bit too.
