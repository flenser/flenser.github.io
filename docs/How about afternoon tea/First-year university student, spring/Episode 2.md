Episode 2: Yui-san's Naughty Side

"Hey Kanata, which one do you think is better?"

A spring morning, sunlight streaming through lace curtains. I turn my gaze towards the voice while tucking into my toast.

She holds up two differently designed earrings before me, and I look back and forth between them.

"Hmm... the right one, I suppose. The blue one's cute."

"Right then, I'll take this one."

Seems she has somewhere to be today. While eating the breakfast Yui-san prepared, I follow her with my eyes alone.

Usually we eat breakfast together, but today she seems almost ready already.

"You're early today."

"Dad called me in. Said to come before work starts."

"Going to the office?"

"Yeah. I'll pop in there, then head to uni... There's a dinner meeting tonight, so I'll be late."

She slips a watch onto her wrist, lets out a small sigh, and tilts her head. She looks a bit reluctant, which is unusual.

I spear a halved cherry tomato in the salad with my fork.

If it were me, I'd be too bothered to bother and just toss the whole cherry tomatoes in. But Yui-san, even though she doesn't usually cook, is somehow meticulous about things like this.

"A dinner party..."

I started to ask, then thought, oh, maybe I'm prying too much. Proof of that was that I locked eyes with Yui-san's dark pupils.

"My father and people from his company."

"...I didn't hear anything about that."

It felt like she'd read my mind, making me feel uncomfortable. Awkward.\
Yui-san will probably join her father's company after graduating university, naturally.\
That's likely why she has frequent dinners with company people even while still a student.

"They're men, so relax."

Yui-san placed her hands on the back of my chair, peered at my face, and smiled teasingly. I scowled and pushed her shoulders away.

"Well, that wasn't exactly what I wanted to hear..."

"Oh? I thought you might be jealous."

I'm impressed she can spout such smooth banter so effortlessly, even though she clearly doesn't mean it.

"I'm working late at my part-time job today too."

"Oh? Until what time?"

"I'm on until closing today, so nine o'clock."

"Well, that's about the same time then. If I finish early, I'll come and pick you up."

Yui-san, now wearing her coat, looked flawless as ever today – nothing to complain about.

"Thanks for breakfast. Take care."

"Mm, right then, I'm off."

After seeing Yui-san off, I popped the last piece of toast into my mouth, then picked up the dishes and stood up.

I'd intended to wash them together, but the dishes Yui-san had used were already in the drainer.

I soaked the sponge in washing-up liquid and worked up a lather.

"...She could at least let me wash the dishes."

I muttered in the empty living room. She manages most things entirely on her own; she really is flawless.

True, she has her issues when it comes to romance, but having her let me stay has turned out to be really good for me.

Having someone nearby to say 'off you go' and 'have a good day' to gives me a sense of security.

Nothing changes just because my housemate is gay. After all, I'm 'out of the question' for her anyway.

The rinsed-off foam was sucked down the drain. I felt as if she could see right through me, this incomplete version of myself as a woman.

＊＊＊

There was something I wanted to do when I became a university student.

A part-time job.

Somehow, I thought a café would be the best place to work part-time.

I love afternoon tea. I adore sweet milk tea with two sugar cubes dropped in, and the biscuits that complement it perfectly.

It's a habit ingrained during my mere four years living in Britain, but even after returning home, the familiar routine refuses to fade.

It all started when I casually ordered a milk tea at a retro, cosy little café near the university and found it delicious. Pointing to a part-time job flyer over the counter, I asked the owner about it, and he hired me on the spot.

The shop is decorated throughout with aquariums, the owner's hobby, and at night, the lights are dimmed to spotlight the aquariums.\
I really like this place; it has such a nice atmosphere.

True to her word, Yui-san appeared about thirty minutes before my shift ended, having apparently finished her dinner gathering. I guided her to a counter seat and handed her the black booklet menu across the table.

"What would you like to drink?"

"Any recommendations?"

"The blend, perhaps? It's the master's original, and it's quite popular. Yui-san, you like coffee, so I'm sure you'll enjoy it."

"Then I'll have that."

"Certainly."

Even close to closing time, a few customers lingered, the steady, gentle background music drowning out conversation.

Yui-san sat down, smiling and looking at me, making me feel a little nervous.

My hand-drip coffee, which the master had drilled me on repeatedly until it was becoming a speciality. It took two weeks before I was allowed to serve it to customers.

"Here you are."

"Thanks."

Would it be alright to ask how today's dinner gathering went? The blue earrings I chose peeked out from between her silky black hair, swaying. When I stared straight at her, she gently asked, "What is it?"

"...Um, how did you find the flavour?"

Words completely different from what I wanted to ask slipped from my lips. It wasn't that I was worried about such things, but somehow, asking that here felt like admitting defeat.

"Yes, it's delicious."

She'd probably say that with a smile even if it didn't suit her taste, I suppose.

The next thirty minutes flew by in an instant.

I finished closing duties quickly and hurried into the changing room. Even if it was early spring, the evenings were chilly, and I had to hurry because I'd left Yui-san waiting on the bench outside the shop.

As I hurriedly removed my apron, a voice called out from behind me, "Hey," and I turned around.

The figure in the identical black apron came into view, and I immediately recognised it as Amasaki-san, who was on the same shift today. She was untying her tied-back brown hair with an annoyed expression, her cat-like round eyes fixing on me.

"That person you were talking about earlier, Aosawa-san? Is she a friend?"

"Well, not exactly a friend... she's a senior from university, but..."

"Oh! So she goes to the same university as you, Aosawa-san? That means she's clever, then."

Amasaki-san opened the locker two spaces away from mine.

She went to a different university to me, but she was a first-year student, the same age.

Truthfully, I'd noticed. Earlier, while wiping the table, Amasaki-san had been watching Yui-san.

Bad premonitions usually come true. I'd caught something in her gaze beyond mere admiration, and it left me feeling rather complicated.

Guessing that pursuing the topic further wouldn't end well, I pretended to check my watch, grabbed my bag, and slammed the locker shut.

Closing it too roughly made the keyring jangle loudly against the lock.

"Hey, that senior from earlier? Introduce me to her sometime."

Here we go. I exhaled softly, trying not to let her notice.

When people found out I lived with Yui at university, several had asked me to be the go-between like this before.

Even when I stupidly told Yui-san, the answer was always no. She hates anything troublesome.

"Do you like women, Amasaki-san?"

"Eh?"

Her round eyes widened. Judging by her surprise, it was an unexpected question.

"No, it's not like that, but..."

If it's not like that, you'd better stop. If you get involved with that person, you'll definitely get more than just a burn.

I wish I could give you that advice, but even if Yui-san isn't hiding it, blabbing about someone's sexuality to others without permission is against the rules.

Truly, you're a sinful person.

"I see. Well, I reckon you'll probably have another chance next time she come by, so if you want to get to know her, you'd be better off talking to her directly. She's not the type who likes being introduced to people. Right then, thanks for your hard work today."

I'd hate to be the one who clumsily introduced you, only for you to get played and dumped, then come crying to me.

I blurted it all out in one breath and fled through the back door.

When I rounded the front, I spotted Yui sitting cross-legged on the bench by the entrance.

"Sorry to keep you waiting."

"It's alright. Shall we head back then?"

It was a bit nippy after all. I felt bad for making her wait, but as she stood up, Yui fixed me with a steady gaze.

Her gaze was higher than mine due to the height difference. When I looked back at her, she gave me a gentle smile that left me utterly flustered.

"I've been thinking this the whole time, but your ponytail is really cute."

I'd rushed over and forgotten to undo the hair I'd tied up for work. She gently stroked my hair, tied a little higher than usual, and a tingling sensation spread through my chest.

"...Are you drunk?"

"I haven't had any alcohol."

This person understands exactly what words make girls happy. Even without meaning to, she'd say things like that to anyone, grinning.

We walked side by side along the night road, a path I usually walked alone. The spring night breeze still felt cold, and I pulled my coat collar up.

"Sorry I couldn't pick you up by car."

"...It's fine. You didn't need to go to that trouble."

Just coming was enough. I forced myself to swallow the words that had risen to my throat.

Saying something like that would only invite his usual teasing. Lately, I felt I was finally beginning to understand what kind of person Yui-san was.

"Dinner gatherings... do they happen every month?"

"Hmm, yes. About once a month, I suppose. Without occasions like this, I wouldn't get to see my father face to face."

He is the president of a major corporation, after all. And since they don't live together, these dinners must be important.

Even as I thought this, I recalled how reluctant Yui-san had seemed this morning.

"Yui-san, you have an older brother, right? You mentioned he gave you his car, didn't you?"

"Yeah, I do. But Yuki-nii doesn't get on with Dad. We don't have meals together. He's gone independent."

Calling him Yuki-nii suggests Yui-san isn't actually on bad terms with her brother. After all, her current car is his hand-me-down.

I was surprised at first, though. I mean, a university student driving a shiny black luxury car?

"Do you have a younger brother, Kanata?"

"Yes. He's in his third year of junior high."

"Somehow, Kanata doesn't really feel like an older sister, does she?"

"Yui-san, you don't feel like a younger sister either. You can do anything, you're so dependable, you feel like the older sister."

"Do I?"

The distance to the station grew shorter. Yui-san's house was two stops away.

I think it's only natural for people to have two sides. It's not strange at all to show different faces depending on the relationship.

Even though I think that, the more I learn, the more it bothers me.

The question arises: why doesn't someone so kind have a girlfriend?

There must be some reason.

Rocked by the train, we chatted about trivial things while I gazed at her perfectly formed profile.

Flawless white skin. Distinctive features. Long lashes. Tall with slender limbs. Stylish too – her appearance is beyond reproach.

Her background is impeccable, and her personality, aside from her poor taste in women, is kind and considerate. I think she's wonderful.

"What is it? Staring like that makes me feel rather embarrassed."

"...I was just thinking how beautiful your face is."

Ah, my true feelings slipped out before I could stop myself. Yui-san's eyes widened slightly, looking startled.

Strange. She's used to hearing such words, isn't she?

"Really? Thank you."

"...There was another staff member besides me, remember? She asked me to introduce you to her earlier, in the changing room."

The train announcement sounded. We were almost at the nearest station.

"Hmm... And what did you say?"

"I said if you want to be friends, you should talk to her yourself. Because I'd be in trouble if I got complaints later about her being played with..."

Yui-san chuckled oddly. When the train doors opened, she took my hand and pulled me, saying, "Let's get off."

"I wouldn't go near one of Kanata's friends, you know."

Her grip was warm, and I had no reason to pull away, so I let her lead me as we started walking.

"Even if she's cute and charming?"

"Do you want me to hit on her?"

"That's not what I meant."

"Well, then, it's fine, isn't it?"

"...I don't really get your criteria for hitting on women, Yui-san."

"Hmm, wanna know?"

Yui-san turned back, grinning mischievously. I nodded, and she tugged my hand firmly, closing the distance between us.

Her lips drew near my ear.

"...When I start wondering what kind of face this girl makes during sex, I suppose."

Her breath brushed my skin as she whispered so softly, so close, that no one else could hear. Startled, I jerked my hand free and pushed her shoulder away forcefully.

My cheeks flushed instantly. What on earth is she saying?

"...Yui-san, you're such a lecher."

"It's a bit late to be saying that now, isn't it? You were the one who asked me in the first place."

Seeing Yui-san laughing as if amused, I realised she was teasing me again. Feeling annoyed, I left her behind and started walking.

"Wait, Kanata!"

"Forget it."

I'd wasted my time thinking seriously about this. Probably, she wasn't thinking much at all.

Next time she asks me to introduce her to someone, I swear I'll leak everything from her chat app accounts to her phone number, I vowed firmly to myself, slamming my pass against the ticket gate.
