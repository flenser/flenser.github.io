Episode 46: Introduce Me Properly, Will You?

Lifting the heavy mug brimming with pale golden liquid, I clinked it with those around me as the organiser called out, "Cheers!"

　It seems there's a custom at drinking parties called "beer first". The first drink is beer, no questions asked.

Feeling almost overwhelmed by the momentum, I followed suit and took a sip of the bitter liquid. The bitterness spread. It wasn't pleasant.

"Ugh," I said, sticking out my tongue. Ritsu-san, sitting opposite me, laughed out loud.

"Kanata-chan, not keen on beer?"

"What's tasty about this? It's just bitter..."

"How adorable. I'll drink that for you, so order something else."

Saying that, Ritsu-san took my mug and handed me the drink order tablet instead.

Meanwhile, Yuri beside me was drinking her beer with a cool expression. Her mug was already more than half empty.

　I tilted my head, wondering what was different between my taste buds and everyone else's.

"Kanata, why not try something a bit easier to drink? They've got sweeter options too."

"Yeah, maybe beer was a bit too soon..."

Ideally, I wanted something not bitter. In the end, I ordered the lemon sour I'd grown accustomed to over the past month.

　This 'exchange meeting', which had taken over a corner of the izakaya, was an annual event. According to Ritsu-san, "Simply put, it's like a mixer."

"But, I know I invited you, but honestly, I'm surprised Yui allowed you to come."

"Eh? What do you mean?"

"I thought Yui would absolutely hate Kanata-chan joining the drinking party."

　Typical Ritsu. She really knows Yui. Spot on, she absolutely hated it. I couldn't say that, so I just gave a wry smile to cover it up.

"...Not at all."

"Hmm?"

These two already know I like Yui. Fortunately, they don't have any prejudice about same-sex love, so even though they know, it's not really a problem, I suppose.

　I'm aware I'm not good with alcohol, so I steel myself to avoid giving anything away.

"Who ordered the lemon sour?!"

A man's voice calls out, making me look up. Before I can say "It's me," Ritsu-san snaps her hand up.

"Here! Over here! Bring it over."

Responding to Ritsu's call, the man, his face flushed from drink, approached me, lemon sour in hand. Suddenly, he grabbed Ritsu's shoulder without a second thought, causing her to widen her eyes in surprise.

"Ritsu, who are these girls? Never seen them before. Introduce us!"

Ritsu, looking annoyed, shook off his hand, snatched the lemon sour from him, then handed it to me.

"No. If you're here to chat them up, try somewhere else."

She made a dismissive shooing gesture, but the man, undeterred, settled himself down next to Ritsu.

"I'm Masaya Akagi. Fourth year like Ritsu. And you lot?"

Unlike me, who was slightly startled by his boldness and flinched, Yuri didn't seem particularly bothered. She popped some edamame into her mouth and replied casually, "I'm Yuri Asumi."

Huh, Yuri, that's impressive. Why is she so used to this? I thought, a little surprised, before introducing myself too. "I'm Kanata Aosawa."

"You two don't have to entertain him. Masaya, go away, seriously."

"Don't say that. By the way, isn't Yui coming today?"

"No, she's got something on."

"Oh, lucky us! When Yui's here, all the girls flock to her."

I could feel a vein throb in my temple. Huh, so that's how it is. So Yui-san really is always surrounded by girls at these drinking parties.

I downed the lemon sour handed to me in one gulp. Maybe it was better Yui-san wasn't here today. If I'd run into a scene like that, I'd probably end up splashing water over her head again.

"Hey, you two. Give me your contact details. Let's be friends."

　Contact details? Come to think of it, I remembered being told not to exchange numbers even if asked for mine. What should I do? I shifted my gaze discreetly to Yuri beside me, seeking her reaction.

Yuri showed no sign of taking out her phone, just squeezing lemon over her fried chicken.

Wow, she's tough. So that's what they mean by someone who's 'good at handling pressure' – someone like Yuri.

　What should I do? My eyes darted around, and then Ritsu gave me a quick glance. It felt like she was saying I didn't need to take out my phone.

"Masaya."

Ritsu snatched the phone Akagi-san was holding out.

"You two look troubled. Besides, these girls have boyfriends, so it's impossible. Give up and go sit at a different table already."

"Eh, really? Oh well, that's a shame..."

Saying that, Akagi-san stood up without a second thought. So this was the 'bad person' Yui-san had mentioned. I was a bit taken aback, but it was an eye-opener.

"...Ritsu-san, I don't have a boyfriend..."

After he'd left, I murmured this, and Ritsu-san grinned.

"A white lie, if you will. Besides, let's be honest, you're practically already like a couple, aren't you?"

Like a couple. Is that how we look? Feeling embarrassed, I looked away. Next to me, Yuri muttered discontentedly, "As for me, I don't even have any prospects."

　My first drinking party turned out to be more enjoyable than I’d expected. True, just as Yui-san said, various men did come over and sit next to me, but Ritsu-san and Yuri skilfully deflected them each time, which was a huge help.

Honestly, I’d thought attending alone might still be too much for me. But I suppose this counts as a form of social learning… After leaving the izakaya, I glanced at my watch – it was just past nine.

"They're saying there's an after-party. What do you reckon? Fancy going?"

Ritsu asked me that, but I shook my head from side to side.

"I reckon Yui-san should be heading back about now, so I'll be off for the night."

"Right. What about Yuri?"

"I haven't had enough to drink yet, so I'll be going."

Unlike me, Yuri seemed to hold her drink well, looking perfectly composed without a hint of flushing. Lucky her. Somehow, it felt like I was the only one getting all fuzzy from the alcohol.

"Right then, Kanata-chan, shall we walk you to the station?"

I shook my head at that suggestion. It's fine, I'm not that drunk. I can walk home properly.

"It's alright. I can get home on my own."

"Understood. Take care, then. Right, cheers for today!"

I waved goodbye to the two of them and walked alone through the bar district, its neon lights sparkling. The night breeze on my cheeks felt cool and refreshing.

I should hurry home. I wonder if Yui-san is back yet. My steps naturally lightened. The drinking party had been fun, certainly. But drinking at home with Yui-san while watching a film... that tasted so much better.

Drinking makes me miss her. Makes me want to see her sooner. Should I contact her? Just as I reached for my phone in my pocket.

A familiar back came into view right before me.

My heart gave a sudden, sharp pang. A sense of déjà vu washed over me. This scene. It brought back that nightmare I'd seen that day. Beside Yui-san. A tall man walking alongside her.

"...Yui-san...?"

The name slipped from my lips without thought. Unconsciously.

　Her long, lustrous hair swayed smoothly as she turned. Her eyes widened, a hint of surprise visible.

"Kanata...?"

They both stopped. Then, I saw the face of the man in the suit who turned around later. A handsome face. Neatly styled, clean-cut hair. Not a student. He looked every bit the office worker. Though I'd never seen his face before, I knew who he was.

　My cheeks, which should have been flushed from the alcohol, grew cold. Why was she walking with a man? Had he just seen her home from the dinner?

"Ah... what a coincidence, Kanata. Were you heading home now?"

Yui-san smiled awkwardly, looking slightly flustered.

"Is this the girl who lives with Yui, the one you mentioned?"

A chill ran through me. "Yui." Why was he calling her by her first name so familiarly? He was a colleague. Why was he acting so intimate...?

"Ah, yes, that's right. Sorry, Shinji, I'm going home with Kanata, so you don't need to walk me in tonight."

Shinji — just as I thought. This man, Kitakami Shinji. Without even looking at Yui-san's face, I stared fixedly at the tall figure.

My heart was pounding loudly. Emotions raged like a muddy torrent inside my chest. An indescribable discomfort washed over me in a wave.

"You're Yui's friend, right? Introduce me properly."

Startled, Yui-san turned back to Kitakami-san, looking flustered.

"Pleased to meet you. I'm Yui's fiancé — Shinji Kitakami."

I felt as though the noise, everything, was receding into the distance.

Time, the world — it felt as though it had stopped, as though only I had been cut out.
