Episode 42: You seem to be having a rather splendid time

April. With the new academic year, I became a second-year university student, while Yui-san entered her fourth year.

Time seemed to pass far more swiftly than during my first year of high school. The year since meeting Yui-san had been the most fulfilling year of my life so far.

On a spring day, the harsh winter cold had completely vanished, replaced by a pleasant breeze.

　I walked slightly behind Yui-san as she pushed the shopping trolley. The shelves were crammed with bottles of alcohol, but Yui-san didn't hesitate, placing a familiar whisky bottle into the basket.

This was the liquor shop near our house. Apparently, it was Yui-san's regular haunt, stocking snacks, imported foods, and various other items.

　This was my first time here. The reason being, I was accompanying her today to buy alcohol for myself, as I would be turning twenty in a few days.

According to Yui-san, since I wouldn't know how much alcohol I could handle at first, it would be better to drink at home and get used to it rather than drinking at a bar.

"I reckon you probably won't be able to drink beer straight away."

"Is that so?"

"Kanata, you don't like bitter things, do you?"

"...I don't."

"Sweet stuff's better, right? For beginners, maybe canned chu-hai?"

We walked past the aisle displaying bottles and headed towards the chilled corner of canned chu-hai along the wall.

I'd never really paid attention before, but there are so many types of alcohol. Yui-san basically only ever drinks highballs, so I'd hardly ever seen canned chu-hai before.

"Pick whichever you like. Since I don't know what'll suit your taste, choose a few."

I picked a few at random as instructed. Peach, lemon, plum, grape. This should be enough. I doubt I'll manage more than that right off the bat.

"I'll put them in the fridge, but whatever you do, don't drink them before your birthday."

Yui-san peered at my face and smiled. A few more days? That's within the margin of error, I thought.

"I know, I know."

"Ah, I'm looking forward to having a drink with Kanata."

Somehow, Yui-san seemed happy. Truth be told, I was secretly excited too. Until now, whenever we watched films together, I couldn't drink alcohol, but that would change from now on.

I felt like I'd gotten just a little bit closer to Yui-san.

After putting the alcohol I'd bought away in the fridge, I squeezed between Yui-san's legs as she sat on the sofa and switched on the projector.

Once I'd confirmed her arm was firmly wrapped around my waist, I pressed the Netflix button on the remote.

"What shall we watch today?"

"What do you fancy watching, Kanata?"

"It's fine if we watch whatever you want for a change."

　Saying that, I placed the remote in her left hand. If I didn't say it like this, she'd always try to prioritise me.

"Really? Well then... Kanata, have you seen this one?"

I looked at the title projected onto the screen. I'd heard of it, but never seen it. That's because I only started enjoying films after I began living with Yui.

I'd never had the habit of watching films before.

"I haven't seen it."

Shaking my head from side to side, I said that. Then, Yui-san pressed play, deciding on this one.

"The lead actress is really cute, you know."

"Oh..."

What was that? A bit dull. Realising I'd let out a dissatisfied sound, I felt the arms holding me tighten their grip.

"Of course, Kanata's cuter though."

"...It doesn't make me happy when you say it like that."

"I genuinely mean it. Kanata's the cutest in the whole world."

Saying that, she gently kissed my cheek. Even though I'd been in a foul mood, just hearing her say something like that made me cheer up again so easily – I suppose that says a lot about me.

　The film began. True, the lead actress was cute. But Yui-san said I was the cutest. Though, really, there was no point feeling jealous of someone on the screen.

"Your birthday's coming up soon. What do you want for your present? I'll buy you anything you like."

"Anything? Hmm, what would be good?"

Even when asked that, only one thing I wanted came to mind. I want Yui-san. I don't need anything else. But I can't say that, so I think seriously.

I already have a necklace, and if I get any more stuffed toys, they'll spoil the simple, unified look of Yui-san's room.

"You don't want anything? A bag? Some jewellery? Anything at all?"

Yui-san's sense of money is completely different from mine, you see. The fact she can pull off high-end brands so effortlessly is down to her innate class, I reckon.

While I was zoning out watching the film, my eyes drifted to the earrings glinting at the actress's ears.

Come to think of it, Yui-san always wears such lovely earrings too. I'd always thought they looked gorgeous. Getting pierced seemed painful, so I'd hesitated, but this might be a good opportunity.

"So, piercings..."

"Piercings? Kanata, did you have your ears pierced already?"

She tucked my hair behind my ear and peered at me. Her fingertips gently pinched my earlobe, tickling me just a little.

"I was thinking of getting them done now."

"Really? You should get it done properly at a hospital, alright?"

"Wouldn't the ones sold at the chemist's be alright?"

"Better to be safe, surely? They'll give you anaesthetic too. It'd be awful if your lovely ears got swollen."

Oh, I see. I didn't know that. But if that's the case, it doesn't seem quite so scary. I feel a little lighter.

Just as her fingers, which had been rubbing my earlobe, pulled away, her lips suddenly pressed against my ear, making my body jump.

"H-hey, Yui-san...! Stop, that tickles!"

"Earrings, eh? I'm sort of pleased, but it's complicated."

"Why? You wear them too, Yui-san."

"Take them out when you get home, alright? They make kissing like this awkward."

Yui-san knows my ears are sensitive and still does this – she's dreadful. Not that I mind, but it really does tickle.

"You're always saying things like that... Choose my earrings properly, won't you?"

"Sure. Hmm, I think something like Alhambra would suit you."

"Alhambra...?"

Hearing this unfamiliar word, I tilted my head. Behind me, Yui giggled softly.

"Nah, nothing. I'll book the present and a nice dinner."

"Wouldn't it be fine just to eat cake at home?"

"No, no, it's your twentieth birthday, so let me celebrate properly."

His arms tightened around me. I was so happy she wanted to celebrate.\
When I'd first returned to Japan, I never imagined university life would be this enjoyable.

I wish this everyday life, spent snuggled up together like this, could go on forever.

She rubs her cheek against the back of my neck, so I tilt my head back slightly to look at Yui.

When our eyes meet, she smiles gently, her eyes narrowing softly.

Then our lips meet tenderly.

It's amazing, isn't it? Without me saying a word, Yui seems to know exactly what I want her to do.

I love her so much. I want to be with her forever. If only it could be not just until I graduate university, but beyond that, forever.

＊＊＊

When I was a child, each day leading up to my birthday felt unbearably long and agonisingly slow. Now, however, the days rush by in a dizzying whirl, leaving no time to feel impatient.

Tomorrow, I turn twenty.

What will change? Nothing much, really. If I had to say, perhaps just that I'll be able to drink alcohol.

　When I spoke to my dad on the phone the other day for the first time in ages, he seemed disappointed he couldn't celebrate with me.

After my last lecture today, I parted ways with Yuri and walked through the university courtyard towards the station.\
I was thinking how pretty the cherry blossoms looked dancing in the wind when, passing by, I spotted a familiar figure sitting on the bench by the fountain.

—Oh, Yui?

Sitting cross-legged beside Yui was another girl, sitting uncomfortably close.\
Yui, fiddling with her phone, didn't seem to notice her, but the girl was tugging at the sleeve of Yui's right arm, pleading for something.

A bad feeling washed over me. A burning, prickling discomfort spread through my chest.

"Hey, Yui, come on. Come over to my place now."

"No way. I told you I've got plans today."

"You always say that. You never play with me anymore."

"Didn't we agree you wouldn't bother me with this?"

From the flow of their conversation, it was clear this girl wasn't just a 'friend'. It was the first time I'd seen Yui's 'playmate'.

　She's cute. Judging by the way they talk, she must be in the same year as Yui. If so, that makes her a senior.

Somehow, she reminds me of the lead actress in that film I saw recently. Which means she's the kind of girl Yui likes...

"You know what? Ever since you started living with that junior girl, you've been less sociable..."

"Really? Or is it just your imagination?"

"I find myself getting jealous somehow."

I know eavesdropping is wrong. But my feet wouldn't move from here.

"It's a bit of a problem if you're jealous."

I'm getting more and more furious. I've come to realise Yui-san isn't interested in me, but then why is she even with me?

Tomorrow's my birthday. She said she'd celebrate it with me. Why is she with another girl right now?

It's infuriating. Yui-san's an idiot. A lecher. A womaniser.

Fuming, I pulled my phone from my pocket and tapped the call history. Then I selected the name at the very top.

　You know what happens if you ignore my call, don't you?

After the ringtone, Yui-san's phone, still in her hand, rang a moment later.

"Ah."

"Eh? Who's calling? Another girl?"

The girl beside her frowned in displeasure. Yui-san ignored her, silencing her with a palm over her mouth.

"Sorry, just be quiet for a moment."

A moment later, the ringing stopped.

"Hello? Kanata?"

"You sound incredibly cheerful, Yui-san."

"Blimey!"

Hanging up, I called out from right beside her. Yui-san straightened up, startled.

"Ka-Kanata...!?"

Yui frantically shook off the girl's clinging right arm and stood up.

"G-Goodness me. What are you doing here? Since when?"

Like someone caught red-handed cheating, Yui couldn't hide her flustered gaze, her eyes darting about.

I glared at Yui with all my might. My eyes alone conveyed it. You — cheater.

　Then, the girl whose arm Yui had flung away shot me a displeased glance before rising and grabbing Yui's right arm tightly once more.

"So this is the junior who lives with Yui? Hmm, are you two... dating?"

She scrutinised me from head to toe, sizing me up, which was thoroughly irritating.

"We're not dating. Kanata's different from me, so don't say weird things."

I knew she said that to protect me, to stop rumours spreading. I knew it, but it still pissed me off.

"Oh, I see. What a waste. Living together and not having sex with Yui? She's bloody brilliant at it."

I could tell Yui was breaking out in a cold sweat. Deep inside, I felt my emotions turning to ice.

Anger, jealousy... once they pass, people become this calm, huh.

"Lately, Yui hasn't been paying me any attention at all, so I just assumed she'd found someone else. If that's not it, are you still angry about me biting you?"

Saying that, she gently stroked Yui's shoulder.

I remember. That shoulder. That distinct bite mark. That wound from back then, this person—

　A snap sounded in my head. Everything before my eyes turned crimson.

"Hey, cut it out—"

Just as Yui tried to restrain her, unable to bear it any longer, my body moved of its own accord.

I grabbed Yui by the collar with all my might and pulled her close. Standing on tiptoe to reach the taller woman, I bit down on her lips.

"Ow...!"

Something clattered to the floor and shattered. I pulled away from her lips, then shoved her chest hard.

"Huh... what...?"

After stumbling back a couple of steps, Yui stared at my face, looking utterly bewildered, as if she had no idea what had just happened.

　She touched the lips I'd bitten, then her gaze fell to the smartphone lying at her feet.\
She must have dropped it in shock, but earlier, there'd been that awful cracking sound.

But I don't care. Because it's Yui's fault.

"...Yui, you idiot."

After glaring at the stunned Yui, I spun on my heel and bolted away as if fleeing.

　It was infuriating. It made my blood boil. I knew it, but I didn't want to see it.

That girl knew a Yui I didn't know.\
She'd been connected to Yui more deeply than I ever had.

It felt like defeat, and the frustration was unbearable.

From heaven to hell. My last day as a nineteen-year-old was shaping up to be the worst day ever.
