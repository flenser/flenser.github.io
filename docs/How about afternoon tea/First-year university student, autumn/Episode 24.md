Episode 24: It's Happier to Stay Forever Behind

Come to think of it, this might be the first time I've ever wanted to celebrate someone's birthday so earnestly.

We're not lovers. Friends — well, not quite that either. The relationship between Yui-san and me is impossible to describe in a single word.

　Our fathers were friends. We were senior and junior in the same faculty at the same university. To outsiders, we were simply people living under the same roof.

Unless my family returned to Japan before I graduated, this cohabitation would continue for the next four years.

Yui-san is now in her third year of university, with just over a year left until graduation. Thinking about that made me feel a little lonely.

　Standing in the kitchen, I listened to the clink of the stirrer against the ice in the glass, staring at its clear, golden liquid.

After graduation, Yui-san is set to join the company her father runs.\
Even if she doesn't have to job hunt, she'll likely be busy once she starts, and the time she has to spare for me might decrease.

　Lost in thought, I suddenly snapped back to reality as my hand stirring the highball was covered from above.

"...Kanata, if you stir it that much, you'll lose all the fizz."

Yui-san, who had come into the kitchen unnoticed, said this with a half-smile. Glancing hurriedly at the wall clock, I saw the hands were almost pointing to midnight.

　Tonight is the ninth. Tomorrow is Yui-san's birthday. While we're planning to celebrate properly tomorrow evening, it was me who asked her to stay in the living room until midnight.

Because I wanted to be the first to say 'Happy Birthday' to Yui-san.

"I was lost in thought, sorry."

Even though I was the one who asked her to stay, look at me now. I feel a little ashamed for getting so absorbed I forgot the time.

"What's wrong? Did something happen?"

Asked gently, her fingertips softly tucked my hair behind my ear.

She never complains about the highball I've stirred too much, ruining it, and just says, "Thank you for making it." I can't help but wish those gentle eyes would stay fixed on me forever.

"It's nothing, really. Just..."

"Hmm?"

"I'm just feeling a bit sad that Yui-san is turning twenty-one."

To be honest, I'm a little bothered that Yui-san used to date an older woman.\
She tells me I'm special, that she likes me, but the fact she dated someone older than her in the past was completely unexpected.

It might be conceited, but I'd always assumed Yui-san preferred younger partners.

"Age gaps are troublesome, aren't they? You can never quite catch up."

"Really? ...Catching up would be lonely too. It's happier to never quite catch up."

Yui gave a faint, lonely smile. I didn't immediately grasp what she meant.

Staring back into those eyes, deep as the night sea, I belatedly understood the true meaning of her words.

　Soon, the long and short hands of the clock were about to overlap.

I see. Yui-san lost her mother at a young age. The dead don't age. The age gap only ever gets smaller.

In the not-too-distant future, she would catch up to her mother's age. How would Yui-san feel then?

　If Yui-san felt lonely about it, then at that moment, I wanted to be by her side, and no one else.

With the click of the clock's hands, I leaned in close, almost rubbing against Yui-san's shoulder.

"...Yui-san, happy birthday."

A little later, the sound of Yui-san's smartphone, which must have been left on the coffee table, vibrated repeatedly.

Still as popular as ever, I couldn't help but smile wryly.\
I'm glad we live together. A slight sense of superiority that I could tell her before anyone else.\
Right now, I'm the only one who has Yui-san all to myself.

"Thanks."

An arm gently wrapped around my waist, pulling me close. As our bodies pressed tightly together, I could tell Yui-san chuckled softly.

"Ah well, I wish I could have celebrated your birthday too, Kanata."

"It's coming soon, you know. April's just around the corner."

Yes, April would surely be here in the blink of an eye.

Half a year had passed since I started living with Yui-san. That meant one-eighth of our time living together had already gone by.

　Yui doesn't have girlfriends. If she sticks to that principle, at least for the next three birthdays, I'll be the first to celebrate hers.

That's fine. Even without labelling our relationship, she's definitely here beside me now.

What more could I possibly ask of Yui? My heart just keeps wavering.

Tomorrow, I'll buy two shortcakes from our regular bakery and wait for Yui.

　I don't know if Yui-san will be able to eat them with her stomach full, but I'm not good with words, so I thought I'd try to show her how I feel in a tangible way.

＊＊＊

The next day. University was closed, so Yui-san started getting ready to go out in the afternoon.\
It was a meal with her father, yet she looked somewhat reluctant, which worried me a little, but I didn't press her further.

"Right then, I'll be back by nine."

Yui-san said this while checking her watch. I nodded silently, hugging Shachi on the sofa. She smiled and peered at my face.

"Are you... sulking?"

She pointed it out with amusement, which I found anything but amusing.

"Not at all, I'm not sulking..."

"I'll be back as soon as I can."

As if she knew my stubborn streak inside out, she gently stroked my head before leaving.

Not the place for kissing, I thought, dangling my legs sulkily on the sofa now empty of its owner.

The vast house fell silent. Yui-san had lived in this huge place all this time — all alone.

　I felt I understood, somehow, why Yui-san loved films.

In the evening, Ritsu-san arrived as promised, bearing champagne. I gratefully accepted it, but she wouldn't take payment for the crucial part.

Apparently, the gift wasn't just the dried salmon. I'd had a little yesterday too, and it was so delicious I'd genuinely thought that was all for Yui-san.

　I wanted to talk a little longer, but Ritsu said she had things to do and left rather abruptly, so I'm waiting for nightfall alone once more.

Is she coming back yet? I wish she'd hurry home.

The more I think about it, the more impatient I grow. The two shortcakes I bought from my favourite patisserie are waiting, waiting for that moment.

　I killed time pacing around the house, doing chores I wouldn't normally bother with, polishing every single glass in sight.

For dinner, I ordered something simple via a delivery app. That's what eating alone is like. Afterwards, I was lounging on the sofa when I suddenly realised I'd fallen asleep.

The sound of the doorbell ringing woke me. I glanced at the clock. It wasn't even nine yet. True to her word, she'd come back early after all.

Rubbing my sleepy eyes, I got up. Had Yui-san forgotten her keys? It was unusual for such a dependable person. Come to think of it, I remembered she'd taken a different bag than usual.

Without even putting on the slippers probably discarded under the sofa, I padded down the hallway.

Suppressing my eager feelings, I hurriedly turned the key and flung the door open.

"Yui-san, welcome home—"

My eyes met those of the tall man standing directly in front of the door. He held a large bouquet of flowers in his hands.

Perhaps startled by the force of the door opening, I recognised the colour of his irises.

　Deep, deep, like the night sea, those gentle black eyes. Over his well-defined features, a familiar likeness overlapped.

This person, surely not—

"Oh, wait, is Yui out?"

Suddenly asked that, I reflexively nodded before he could introduce himself.

"Should've checked her schedule, my bad. Ah, you must be Kanata-chan... right?"

"...Ah, um, yes, nice to meet you..."

"Pleased to meet you. I'm Yukiya Ichinose, Yui's older brother."

His smiling expression gave me a sense of déjà vu. Ah, I thought, just as I suspected.

There was no mistaking it.

That smile was so very similar.

The older brother of Yui-san was really standing right there.
