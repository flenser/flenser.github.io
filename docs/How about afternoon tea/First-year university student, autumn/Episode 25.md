Episode 25: Oh, Was I Not Invited?

"Yui-san went out for dinner with her father today... I think she'll be back shortly. If you'd like, would you care for a coffee inside?"

I blurted out the invitation and ushered him inside, but then I remembered how Yui-san had grumbled the other day, insisting she'd never let me meet her brother.

It had been incredibly difficult to win back her favour after that.

　Yui-san, clinging to me and refusing to let go, proceeded to lecture me at length about how popular Yukiyasu-san was with women, how there are plenty of rivals, and even if he falls for you, you'll definitely have a hard time, how falling for him would be nothing but trouble, and how I should just give up.

That sounds exactly like you, Yui-san — I almost said it, but wanting her to cheer up quickly, I let it slide and just listened silently.

　And now, that infamous Yui-san's brother is standing right before me.

Upon entering the living room, Yukiyasu-san sat down on a dining table chair. Apparently, "the sofa is Yui's special seat, so she'll get upset if I sit there."

Oh, I didn't know that. I always sit on Yui-san's special seat without a second thought, but she's never said anything about it.

"Yuki-san. Would black coffee be alright?"

Peering out from the kitchen to ask, he nodded with a smile, saying, "Yes, thank you."

I brewed Yui-san's favourite blend. Glancing at the clock, it was nearly nine o'clock.

Honestly, it wouldn't be strange if Yui-san came home any minute now.

　I steal glances at Yukiyasu-san while brewing the coffee. His uncoloured black hair is the same shade as Yui-san's. His overall impression is refreshingly clean-cut, the very picture of neatness.

What's more, he's tall. Since Yui-san is tall, I'd assumed her brother might be too.

No wonder Yui-san speaks so highly of him. I certainly thought Yukiyasu-san must be incredibly popular with women.

"Here you are."

I placed the coffee in front of Yukiyasu-san.

"Thank you. Sorry to keep you up. I really should have checked Yui's schedule properly."

"Not at all. I've heard so much about you from Yui, Yukiyasu-san. It's lovely to meet you."

"It's lovely to meet you too. Just as Yui said, you really are lovely. How's it going with Yui? Having fun?"

　There it is, that Ichinose bloodline. The womanising gene.

Suddenly, he was staring into my eyes and calling me cute. I didn't know how to react, so I let my gaze wander. Yukiyasu chuckled softly.

"Yes, thank you. Yui-san is always so kind to me."

I kept quiet about the one time we'd argued. Then Yukiyasu took a sip of his coffee and smiled happily.

"I'm glad you're getting along well. Speaking of which... do Yui and my father meet up that often?"

"I think they have dinner together about once a month. She also mentioned company people join them sometimes."

"Company people...? Ah, Shinji."

—Shinji?

I should have forgotten him completely, yet the moment I heard that name, a memory resurfaced in my mind.

　On the drive home from the aquarium, Yui-san had received a call. The name displayed on the satnav was definitely — Kitakami Shinji.

Who on earth was that person? Noticing my anxious expression, Yukiyasu-san smiled.

"Ah, did Yui tell you? That Dad and I don't get along?"

"Er... yes."

　His terrifyingly sharp intuition was another trait he shared with Yui. Siblings are amazing, I thought. Yukiyasu really was the spitting image of Yui.

"...So Yui is worried after all?"

What should I do? I didn't know if I should just say plainly, "Yes, she is worried," and found myself looking away, my eyes darting around.

To say she doesn't care would be a lie. You mentioned how difficult it is when your father and brother don't get along. It's obviously better for Yui-san if they were on good terms.

But the fact that Yui-san hasn't sought reconciliation with either her brother or her father until now means there must be some reason.

"...Well, I suppose. Unless you ask Yui-san directly, it's hard to say..."

　In the end, my reply remained vague. It was practically the same as saying, "Yes, she is concerned."\
I'm hopeless with words, even by my own standards. I'm so exasperated I can't even speak.

"Heh heh, I see. That's right. Sorry for troubling you."

Yukiya-san said that and smiled. If he knew it would trouble me, I wish he hadn't asked in the first place. He's just like Yui-san in that way too.

　Truly, they resemble each other in every single way.

But — even when Yukiyasu-san gazed at me, even when he called me cute, I didn't feel that same tightening in my chest like when Yui-san said it.

Was it because he simply didn't feel that way about me?

"...Yui's always been very sensible, never really acted selfishly. Seems she hasn't changed much even now."

　Somehow, I could imagine that. Lately, Yui-san has started showing her feelings more openly — getting jealous, sulking — but still, the overwhelming majority of the time, I have no idea what she's thinking.

"Because she never complains much, I'm always worried. I want Yui to live much more freely."

Freely. What did that mean? Not being bound by her father? Or...

　I stared back intently into his eyes. I couldn't read any emotion in those deep-coloured irises, and I thought how remarkably like Yui-san he was, even in this.

Does Yukiyasu-san know? That Yui-san is homosexual.

Just because Yui-san doesn't hide it at university doesn't mean she does with her family.\
In fact, Yui-san's father probably doesn't know.

What should I say in reply? Just as I hesitated slightly, a sudden noise from the entrance made me jump and straighten up.

"Kanata? Is someone here?"

Yui had come home. Her voice sounded displeased, having apparently noticed Yukiyasu-san's shoes by the entrance.

I scrambled to my feet and headed for the door connecting the hallway to the living room. But before I could open it, the door swung open forcefully.

"Yui, welcome home."

Yui looked startled, her gaze shifting between me, standing awkwardly midway, and Yukiyasu.

"W-welcome home, Yui..."

After a moment, Yui seemed to grasp the situation and gave a slightly displeased look.

"...Why is Yuki-nii here?"

"I came to celebrate your birthday... Oh, wasn't I invited?"

Yukiya stood up and gently handed Yui the bouquet he'd placed on the table.

"Happy twenty-first birthday."

"...Thank you. But next time you come, please let me know."

"Sorry, sorry. I wanted to surprise you."

　She sighed softly, then smiled with relief. Phew, I'd thought for a moment that her displeased expression meant an argument was starting, but it seems I needn't have worried.

"Oho, you've got quite the nice present there."

Yukiyasu noticed the pale blue paper bag hanging from Yui's hand and remarked teasingly.

　I immediately recognised it as a bag from a high-end jewellery brand.

"That's from Dad... Nah, that can't be. From Shinji?"

"Whoever it's from doesn't matter, does it? It's none of your business, Yukiyasu."

"Shinji" again. Who on earth is that? My chest felt unsettled. It was her birthday today, so why would someone from work be joining her dinner with her father?

"You're being rather cold, aren't you? I went to the trouble of bringing Yui a present too."

"Isn't it these flowers?"

Yui-san lowered her gaze to the bouquet in her hands and tilted her head. Then, Yukiyasu-san slipped his hand into his jacket's inside pocket.

"Not at all. The real thing is this."

Saying that, he pulled out a thick, pure white envelope tied with a ribbon.

"Ta-dah! Travel vouchers. Since you're here, why not go somewhere with Kanata-chan?"

Judging by its thickness, the envelope seemed to contain quite a few vouchers. Yui accepted it without fuss and smiled.

"Really? I'm so happy. Thank you, Yuki-nii."

"You're welcome. University life seems long but passes quickly, so enjoy it to the fullest. Right then, I'll be heading back now. Kanata-chan, you two should properly celebrate Yui's birthday properly from here on."

Saying this, Yukiyo-san looked at me and smiled warmly, so I nodded in acknowledgement. It seemed he was well aware of our preparations to celebrate Yui-san's birthday.

"Ah, yes. And... Kanata-chan, give me your contact details. Just in case something comes up in the future."

Hearing that, Yukiyasu-san pulled out his smartphone, so I followed suit and fished mine out of my pocket.

I displayed the chat app's QR code, about to show it to Yukiyasu-san, when suddenly, with a thud, Yui-san grabbed my smartphone screen with her palm and stopped it.

"Eh...?"

Yukiyasu-san and I both turned our gaze to the source of the sound at our feet.

A pale blue paper bag lay discarded at our feet. So that was the sound – it had fallen.

Yui-san, her hands full with the bouquet and the paper bag, must have let go of the bag to grab my phone.

　When forced to choose between letting go of the bouquet from Yukiyasu-san or the luxury brand accessory, she’d toss the accessory without hesitation – that was so typical of Yui-san.

With a bright smile, Yui-san covered my phone screen with her palm and laughed.

"Yuki-nii, don’t worry, it’s fine. If anything happens, I'll contact you myself."

I gasped at her smile, which carried an undeniable weight. Yukiyasu looked back and forth between my face and Yui's, then suddenly smiled gently.

"Is that so? Well then... I suppose it's alright."

Yukiyasu picked up the paper bag Yui had tossed aside and placed it gently on the edge of the sofa.

"The present itself isn't at fault, you know. Treasure it properly. It must have cost a pretty penny. If you're too cold to it, Shinji'll cry, you know?"

Noticing my anxious fidgeting, Yukiyasu turned to me.

"Ah, I suppose you've never met him, Kanata-chan? This Shinji fellow..."

"Yuki-nii's childhood friend, the son of the managing director at your father's company."

Yui-san cut him off with a sigh.

"Enough already... I don't want to talk about Shinji until his birthday."

Yui-san spat out the words with obvious distaste. Yuki-san chuckled, clearly sharing her dislike. It seemed both siblings had a poor rapport with this man named Kitakami Shinji.

"Right then, I really must be off now. See you, Yui, Kanata-chan."

Having drunk just one cup of coffee and without lingering, Yukiyasu left.

He'd probably squeezed in the visit between busy schedules, and though Yui looked a little dissatisfied, she still seemed rather pleased somewhere deep down.
