Episode 21: I Want to See High School Yui

The midsummer heat had completely subsided, and a pleasant breeze blew through on this autumn day.

Hot coffee in hand, I walked around the campus cafeteria, glancing around as people bustled about.

The person who'd called me out was nowhere to be seen. They should have messaged me via chat app saying they were around here.

"Kanata-chaaaan! Over here, over here!"

Spotting a waving figure in the distance, I waved back. That long, fluffy hair, dyed a pink ash shade from spring through summer, had changed to a milky tea brown.

"Ritsu-san, I didn't recognise you with your hair colour changed..."

As I ran towards her, I noticed a familiar head of blonde hair sitting beside her.

"Eh... why is Yuri with Ritsu-san?"

Slurping her cup noodles, she raised one hand in a 'yo' gesture.

Yuri, eating seafood noodles again.

　It was undoubtedly my friend, Azumi Yuri. She was my closest friend at university and had even been my refuge when I ran away from home after a fight with Yui-san.

But why these two were together, I couldn't fathom. I tilted my head in confusion.

Noticing my puzzled expression, Ritsu-san smiled brightly.

"We've become friends since then, you know."

"Since then" — she meant that runaway incident. Ritsu, with her incredibly wide circle of acquaintances, had used every trick in the book to track down my hiding place and obtain Yuri's contact details.\
That seemed to be how the two had started interacting.

"Yuri never said a word to me about this..."

"Well, you didn't ask."

The weight drained from my shoulders. Apparently, when asked, Yuri's chat app icon or background was the logo of a rock band Ritsu also liked. They hit it off from there and became friends who went to gigs together.

"...So, why did you call me out today?"

"Next month is Yui's birthday, right?"

"Yes, it is."

"Yui's popular, isn't she? She gets loads of presents, that one."

"I suppose... she does."

It was easy to picture Yui-san, her arms full of presents.

"It happens every year, but around this time, girls who like Yui start asking me what she'd like as a present."

Ritsu sighed, looking thoroughly fed up.

"And how does that relate to me...?"

"I was thinking I could ask Kanata-chan beforehand what she's getting Yui, and steer things so we don't end up with duplicates."

Hearing that, I was taken aback. Why would she go to such lengths? Admittedly, it would be nice if the presents didn't overlap.

"But I haven't decided what to get her yet."

"Well, let me know when you have. Until then, I'll just tell the others something Yui probably wouldn't want."

"Um... why are you doing this for me?"

"Hm? Because that way, she'll be happier, won't she?"

I understood that getting multiple copies of the same thing wouldn't be pleasant. But why was Ritsu-san being considerate only towards me? As I tilted my head, Ritsu-san gave a meaningful smile.

"...So, Yuri, why are you with Ritsu-san?"

"I was just making plans with Ritsu-san for our next expedition. I've got no business with Kanata."

On the cafeteria table lay a Hokkaido tourist guidebook. When I asked, "What's an expedition?", it seemed they were chasing their favourite rock band all the way to Hokkaido to see their live show. They'd be doing some sightseeing together while they were at it.

"...Somehow, it feels like Ritsu-san's taken Yuri away from me. It's complicated."

Yuri was my closest friend at university, yet here she was making travel plans with Ritsu-san. And I hadn't even been on a trip with her yet.

As I muttered this, Ritsu-san laughed out loud.

"I'll give that line right back to you, Kanata-chan. The reason Yui's been hard to get hold of lately is because of you, isn't it?"

Hearing this, I flinched.

"...What are you talking about?"

"Nothing much?"

She dodged the question, but I knew she'd hit a sore spot. Ritsu-san is very perceptive.

It was true. Ever since that day I begged her not to go, Yui-san's nights out had visibly decreased.

After that, she stopped staying out overnight. Even if she was out late, she'd come home.

　That didn't mean she'd stopped going out altogether, though. There were definitely nights when I wondered if she'd been meeting up with other women.

I couldn't restrict her actions that much. We weren't lovers, after all.

If there was one thing that bothered me... it was that she hadn't kissed me once since then.

I didn't know if it was because I'd been startled when she slipped her tongue in and, in my panic, had bitten down. Or if her feelings had changed.

　Yui-san hasn't said anything. But I can tell she clearly prioritises me.

For now, that was enough.

I feel that if I give it just a little more time, I might be able to glimpse into the depths of her heart.

The reason she "doesn't make lovers" must surely lie beyond that.

I also wanted to take the time to properly sort out what I wanted to become with her.

　After parting ways with the two of them, I headed home. Thinking I might enjoy afternoon tea for the first time in ages, I bought a roll cake from the patisserie near the station. Yui-san had mentioned she’d be late tonight due to a dinner gathering.

Next month, on the tenth of October, is Yui-san’s twenty-first birthday.

What should I get her? It’s not easy to think of something that would delight her – someone who can get anything she wants.

　That expensive-looking single-stone diamond necklace she always wears. Was that really a gift from someone?

It looks lovely against her pale neckline.

But she changes her nails and accessories constantly – why does she keep wearing just that one thing?

　Getting home, I peek into her jewellery tray in the living room.

I knew it, but that necklace isn't there.\
I work part-time too, so I could buy her jewellery if I wanted to, but honestly, I wasn't confident I could find anything better than that.

"...Maybe I should just ask her directly..."

Knowing her, she'd probably just smile and say she'd be happy with anything.

"I'm home."

Yui-san returned after nine. "Tired," she sighed, plopping down onto the sofa.

"Welcome home."

As if to say I've been waiting, I settled down beside her. Peeking out from beneath her thin knit top, that necklace was indeed gleaming.

"Yui-san."

"Hmm?"

She turned to me, removing the silver studs peeking from beneath her black hair.

"Next month is your birthday, right? Is there anything you'd like?"

Rather than giving her something she didn't need, I wanted to give her something she did. Since I couldn't manage thoughtful gestures like Yui-san, my conclusion was the utterly simple method of "asking directly".

"Eh? It's fine. Besides, I didn't do anything for your birthday, Kanata."

Hearing her say that so casually made me bristle. My birthday was in April, and at the time, Yui-san hadn't known about it.

But I know her birthday now, and I want to celebrate it for her.

It's not pleasant to be denied that.

"...It doesn't matter. Surely you could let me celebrate her birthday?"

When I said that, Yui-san smiled and gently stroked my head. Her kind eyes looked at me.

"That sentiment alone is quite enough."

"Don't you want anything? Anything at all?"

"Hmm, let me see..."

Yui-san seemed to ponder for a moment. Then, as if struck by an idea, she exclaimed, "Ah!"

"Perfume. A new one. You choose it, Kanata."

She added, "Just choosing it is fine." What on earth, I thought, feeling the tension drain from my shoulders.

"...Just choosing? Isn't that hardly a present?"

"You should spend your part-time wages on yourself."

My gaze fell on the bottle of Yui's favourite perfume sitting on the tray.\
It was certainly running low. I'd always thought the ribbon on that pink bottle was rather cute.

But still.

"...I don't want to give perfume. You mustn't change it."

"Eh? Why?"

"Because I like the way Yui-san smells right now."

I like that sweet scent, the blend of that perfume and the gentle fragrance from her long hair. That's why I don't want her to change it. Quite seriously.

"You like this scent? Well then, shall we both wear the same one?"

"No, thank you. I wouldn't want to lose the scent of Yui-san."

If I were to wear that fragrance myself, I'd lose the scent of her.

What I love is Yui-san's scent; it's not just the perfume itself I like.\
When I stubbornly refused, Yui-san smiled happily and said, "Then I won't change it."

"Well then, I can't think of anything else I'd like..."

　The diamond glinted on her chest, reflecting the light. Intrigued, my fingers reached out of their own accord.

Careful not to touch the stone, I gently tugged the chain with my fingertips.

"...This necklace. You always wear it, don't you? Was it a present from someone?"

Yui's eyes widened at the sudden question.

"This? I bought it myself when I started university."

"Yourself...?"

　Really? I looked at her doubtfully, and Yui gave a mischievous smile. The kind she gives when teasing me.

"What on earth were you imagining? Were you jealous, perhaps?"

I pushed her shoulders back as she leaned in closer, peering at my face.

"I wasn't jealous. I just thought it might be a memento from an ex-girlfriend. A pair of necklaces, maybe..."

"Ahaha, she couldn't afford that as a high schooler, surely."

So it really is incredibly expensive, then. Because it clearly sparkles differently.

"...Right. It's just that it's so beautiful, I couldn't help wondering."

Honestly, I felt relieved. To avoid her reading my jealousy and relief, I hurriedly looked away from her.

"Oh? Well then, I'll buy you the same one, Kanata."

"Eh? I-I couldn't possibly accept something so expensive. Besides, we're talking about a present for Yui-san right now. What would you do with one for me?"

"Getting matching ones as a present, sort of?"

"I was the one who brought it up, but let's just leave the necklace aside for now. I only asked because I wondered if you treasured it because it was a pair with your ex-girlfriend..."

"Hey, why are you bringing up my ex-girlfriend all of a sudden? Do I look like I'm still hung up on her?"

　Asked so casually, I almost nodded honestly and said yes.

Because, this person who claimed to be "devoted" deciding never to have a lover again must mean something serious.

And the fact she's stuck to that decision since her first year of university suggests something truly shocking must have happened.

Was she really that adorable? More than me? Honestly, just thinking about it makes me furious.

When I fell silent, unsure how to reply, Yui burst out laughing.

"I really am over it, so don't make that face."

That face, she said. Had I really looked that dissatisfied? I couldn't tell if those words were just a cover-up or her true feelings.

"...Hey, Yui-san."

"Hmm?"

"Let me see your graduation album. I want to see you as a high school student."

When I said that, her eyes widened. Perhaps taken aback by such an unexpected request, she froze in surprise.

"Eh, now?"

"Now."

I stared intently into her eyes. If she'd dated classmates back then, her ex-girlfriend should be in there.

　Her long lashes fluttered repeatedly. When I urged her on, Yui scratched her cheek, looking troubled.

I'd see for myself just how cute she was.

I didn't know how much Yui had loved her.

But right now, I thought, I wouldn't be satisfied unless I made Yui say I was cuter.
