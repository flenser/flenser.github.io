Episode 22: How Do You Lick Your Own Tongue?

I'd let Yui into my room before, but this was my first time entering hers.

Feeling slightly nervous, I followed her tall frame.

"I haven't opened my yearbook since graduation, I think."

Stepping through the doorway, I caught her soft scent and drew it deep into my lungs.

　Inside, there was one large bed and a desk; the room was simply and neatly arranged, just as I'd imagined.

She opened the wardrobe and reached inside. Taking the thick, blue-covered album, she gestured for me to sit on the bed. She sat down beside me.

The blue cover bore the name of a prestigious girls' university's affiliated high school, printed in gold lettering.

　She must have enrolled expecting to advance internally, so why did she reapply to a national university? She's naturally intelligent, but I wouldn't describe her as the studious type.

I opened the stiff cover.

"...Do you find looking at yearbooks enjoyable?"

"It is enjoyable. Which class were you in, Yui-san?"

"Hmm, in third year, I think it was Class 2."

She searches for the relevant page and turns it. Among the photos of about forty girls, Yui-san is found immediately.

"Wow, cute! But she does look a bit mischievous..."

Despite it being a girls' school for the upper classes, there's a beautiful girl wearing piercings in the photo. Her striking features and polished appearance made her stand out from the rest, so she was easy to spot.

"My grades weren't bad, so no one said anything about it."

I scanned the other girls one by one. Looking for someone cute with a cat-like face, the sort Yui-san might like.

True to a school attended by well-bred girls, they were all neat and pretty. With each glance I cast, my confidence dwindled a little.

"...What are you looking at so intently?"

"Yui, was there anyone in here you liked?"

I stared intently into Yui's eyes as she sat beside me. I didn't know if she'd tell me, or if she might dodge the question, but I couldn't help asking.

"...No, there wasn't."

"Then, which class was your ex-girlfriend in...?"

When I asked that, Yui seemed to realise my true intent and gave a faint, amused smile.

"Is that your real purpose? Did you want to see my ex-girlfriend?"

Peering at my face as she asked that, I felt slightly awkward and looked away.

"Don't be coy, tell me."

"Sorry, but she's not in here."

"Hmm... So she wasn't a classmate. Was she a senior? A junior? What was Yui-san's ex-girlfriend like...?"

　Closing the yearbook with a snap, I assumed the person I sought wasn't there. Yui-san smiled, looking troubled. I knew she didn't want to talk about it. So I just stayed silent, waiting patiently for her answer.

"Hmm... Do I have to tell you?"

"Then I'll tell you about my ex-boyfriend too, so please tell me."

"Eh? No way. I don't want to hear about Kanata's ex-boyfriend."

　Yui-san's immediate response made me laugh involuntarily. I gently reached out and took her hand. I know a useful trick for moments like this.

"Hey, Yui-san, please. Tell me."

Yui-san is kind, so she's weak to a woman's pleas. It might be a bit manipulative, but I really wanted to know.

"Well... What are you going to do with that information?"

"I just want to know, Yui-san."

Hearing that, Yui sighed, as if resigned.

"She was a university student. Four years older than me. We dated from my first year of high school until my third."

A university student? Four years older? So, sixteen-year-old Yui was dating a twenty-year-old woman?

"...That's criminal."

"I knew you'd say that. That's why I didn't want to tell you."

"Where on earth did you meet someone like that?"

"Well, she was my tutor..."

"So, Yui, you made a move on your teacher?"

"...Shouldn't we say she made a move on her student?"

"But you were the one who came on to her, weren't you?"

"Just say whatever you like..."

　Yui-san looked away awkwardly. She must have been reluctant to talk about it, sighing heavily as she slumped her shoulders.

"So, Yui-san, you liked older women..."

Age was a barrier I couldn't overcome no matter how hard I tried. I was two years younger than her, and six years younger than her ex-girlfriend.

"Age never really bothered me..."

"Is that so..."

But it's not exactly common to hear about a schoolgirl dating her same-sex tutor. The fact Yui-san hesitated so much to say this means she probably hasn't told anyone before. To avoid causing her trouble.

"What's your ex-girlfriend doing now?"

"If she hasn't quit, she's probably a schoolteacher. We broke up just before graduation, and I haven't been in touch since, so I don't know."

　Yui had previously said she'd been dumped. That it was her fault, too.

After graduating high school and finally becoming a university student, she should have been freed from that secret relationship. So why did they break up?

The more I asked, the less I understood.

Having lived with Yui all this time, I know she'd make a perfect girlfriend. ...Setting aside her poor taste in women.

"...Do you still... care about it?"

"Goodness no. That was years ago."

"Why did you break up?"

"Hmm... Do you want to know?"

"I do. I want to know more about you, Yui-san."

At that, Yui-san smiled gently. Suddenly, her arm reached out and touched my cheek.

"...I'll tell you sometime. That's enough about that for today."

Her deep black eyes admonished me. It felt like she was telling me not to pry any further.

Beyond the line she'd drawn, I wanted to leap in right now, but she wouldn't let me.

Even though she says she likes me. Even though she says I'm cute. Discontent, I pouted slightly and looked down.

"...Then, just one last question. Was she cuter than me?"

Yui-san chuckled softly. I lifted my face, about to complain, "Why are you laughing?" Her eyes, gazing at me, were calm, serene even, yet they stirred my heart relentlessly.

"Not at all. Kanata's cuter."

　A hand touched my cheek, sliding to the back of my neck. I realised I was pinned there, unable to escape, but her face drew closer anyway, and our lips touched naturally.

It was light, just a touch, over in an instant. When our eyes met at such close range, Yui-san narrowed hers and smiled.

"...Why did you kiss me?"

"If you think someone's cute, isn't it only natural to want to kiss them?"

Is that so? I don't know. But being kissed like this in Yui-san's room, on her bed, made me conscious of it just a little.

"...If you go by that logic, doesn't that mean you don't usually think I'm cute?"

Lately, especially. It's been over half a month since I bit Yui-san. But she hadn't kissed me once since then.\
I was aware I'd said something troublesome.

"I always want to kiss you. I'm just holding back. Lately, my tongue's been sore from being bitten by someone."

Her dark eyes, staring straight at me, held a mischievous glint. Yui-san is kind, but sometimes she can be terribly mean.

"...It was just a little cut, wasn't it? A wound like that's nothing serious. A wound inside your mouth heals quickly if you just lick it."

Truth be told, I feel terribly bad about it. So this is just me covering up my embarrassment. I did apologise properly for hurting you, so I hope you'll forgive me for talking back a little.

"How am I supposed to lick my own tongue? If you insist, why don't you lick it, Kanata?"

Lick what? Yui-san's tongue? Stunned into silence by such an outrageous suggestion.

"...It's healed up long ago, hasn't it?"

"Nope, it still hurts."

The hand touching my shoulder tightened. My body, bearing her weight, toppled easily, sinking abruptly into the bed that smelled of her.

"H-hold on, Yui-san...!"

I started to say there was no way the wound from half a month ago hadn't healed, but then, at a distance closer than I'd imagined, I found myself swallowing hard.

　My heart began to pound rapidly. Pinned down, her necklace swayed before my eyes. It was just like that dream. Why did I have to remember it at a time like this?

My face flushed instantly.

The hand that touched me gently traced my cheek, its thumb brushing my lips. In the silent room, only the sound of fabric against fabric echoed.

　My breathing quickened, my chest rising and falling. I looked up at Yui-san, hoping she wouldn't notice my tension, and found her eyes fixed on me with what seemed like adoration. Was I just imagining it?

When she looked at me like that, I couldn't refuse.

"...Don't bite me."

Her thumb parted my lips slightly and entered my mouth. Then her face drew closer.

　We weren't even dating; I shouldn't be doing this. I knew it would tear my heart apart again.

I should have refused, but my hands could only grasp her knitwear. It was no different from clinging to her.

Through the gap in my parted lips, her sweet tongue slipped in smoothly, replacing the thumb.

"Mm, mm..."

The moment her soft tongue tangled and brushed against mine, my hips lifted involuntarily. My head grew hazy. Why? It wasn't my first kiss, yet indescribable emotions washed over me like waves, one after another.

Wet sounds echoed through the silent room. She sucked on the tongue I tried to push away in agony, and I thought, I can't take this anymore.

　Breathing was difficult. I felt like I might pass out. With what little reason I had left, I pushed her shoulders. Then, after one last lick of my lips, she pulled away without fuss.

"...That... that was long. I thought I was going to die..."

Panting, I desperately pumped air into my lungs. Yui-san wiped my damp lips with her thumb and smiled contentedly.

"Thanks. Seems my wound's healed, thanks to you, Kanata."

Saying that, she stuck out her perfectly unblemished tongue. I gave her shoulder a hard smack.

Hiding my mouth with my arm to avoid another kiss, I stared up at Yui-san.

"...You just wanted to kiss me, didn't you?"

　When I retorted, Yui laughed. She didn't seem inclined to go any further, so I felt a little relieved and sat up.

Somehow, I felt like I'd been outmanoeuvered. Yui's always like this. I sighed.

"...It's fine. The ex-girlfriend thing is over and done with anyway..."

"Exactly. And right now, I like you best. Isn't that good enough?"

　I bit my tongue, stopping myself from saying 'That's not good enough'. There'd be no end to arguing back. I already knew I could never win an argument with Yui-san.

"...Just think about what you want for your birthday present, okay?"

"Ah, yeah, I've decided what I want."

"Eh? What is it?"

"I'll tell you on the night, so you don't need to prepare anything."

"Why on the day...?"

If she tells me on the day, I won't be able to give her the present that very evening, I think. Wondering why, I tilt my head, but Yui-san says, "It's alright," in a soothing tone, so I reluctantly nod.

"There's a dinner party that day, so I reckon I'll be back around nine. So, just wait at home, alright?"

"Alright..."

　I still don't quite understand what she's up to, I think. Come on, let's head back, Yui-san says, standing up, so I follow suit.

Ah, I wanted to stay cuddled up in Yui-san's room a little longer, I suppress that feeling and head towards the living room.

Well, I suppose we can cuddle on the sofa too, so it's fine.

As long as Yui-san is there, anywhere is fine.
