Episode 28: That's the thing about her, though — it's rather endearing

Yukiya-san covered the travel expenses, and since this trip was to celebrate Yui-san's birthday, I should really have been the one making all the arrangements. Yet, in the end, Yui-san handled everything — from booking the accommodation to reserving the train tickets.

As usual, I simply let her take my hand and follow along.\
Before I knew it, we were aboard the limited express bound for Hakone-Yumoto.

　Unlike ordinary trains, this one offered splendid views and was incredibly comfortable to ride. It truly lived up to its name, the Romance car, I thought with admiration.

As usual, she naturally offered me the window seat. She was just as kind today as ever.

Spreading out the ekiben, the holiday feeling really started to kick in.

"I'm terribly sorry to have you do everything for me. It's supposed to be your birthday trip, Yui-san."

"It's fine, I enjoyed preparing it. Don't worry about it."

Lately, I feel Yui-san has been spoiling me a bit too much.\
I just keep saying, 'I'd like this,' or 'I'd like that,' and Yui-san always makes those wishes come true.\
Even now, without me saying a word, she's stuck a straw into a paper carton of tea and placed it right in front of me.

　It's surprising, but this is just how Yui-san always is.

I suck on the straw with a slurp. Yui-san once said she was the type to go all out for someone, but honestly, I was sceptical at first.

But now I get it.

It wasn't a lie. If she's this devoted without us even being together, I wonder what it'd be like if we were. Yui-san is utterly kind.

"...Yui-san, apart from your terrible taste in women, you really are flawless, aren't you?"

"What's that supposed to mean? I can't tell if you're complimenting me or insulting me."

Yui-san laughed like that, but I thought, that one flaw is quite the bombshell.

　Everyone gets ensnared by her kindness and forgets, but you have to remember that her kindness isn't directed solely at you.

Still, there are plenty of people who are fine with that, so I suppose women are always drawn to Yui-san.

　I'm selfish, so I absolutely cannot accept being just one of the crowd.

If I actually saw her doing the things he usually does for me with another woman right in front of me, I'd definitely feel awful.

We're often alone together, so it's easy to forget.

"Ah... come to think of it, Ritsu-san sent a request for souvenirs."

"Eh? I didn't get any message about that."

"She said to buy as many black eggs as I could find. She's going to eat them all herself. But eating one is supposed to add seven years to your life... so eating too many probably isn't a good idea, right?"

"...Is she aiming for the world record for longevity or something?"

We exchanged glances and burst out laughing.

The sky peeking through the window was an endless blue. Once autumn ends, winter comes, and a year passes in the blink of an eye.

　The train reached its destination after an hour and a half. Unable to contain my excitement, I tugged Yui-san's hand and pulled her through the ticket gates.

From home to Shinjuku Station, I'd just followed along, Yui-san holding my hand. But once we reached our destination, it was no big deal.\
Honestly, I still can't get the hang of changing trains. London Underground was easier than Tokyo's, at least.

"Hey, Yui-san, hurry up!"

"There's no need to rush. The hot springs aren't going anywhere."

"But..."

I'd pored over the guidebook for this very day, and I wanted to enjoy it to the fullest.

Would she think me childish, even at nineteen?

Looking up at Yui-san, wondering if I'd been a bit of a nuisance, she narrowed her eyes and gently stroked my head.

"It's that sort of thing that makes you cute, you know."

Avoiding her gaze as if to hide his embarrassment, he tugged her hand.\
That ability to say such things so casually was one of Yui-san's rather cunning traits.

"So, where did you want to go again?"

"First, a café. I've looked up the place, so leave it to me."

"Right then. I suppose I'll take you up on that offer and let you lead the way."

She gently took my hand again, our fingers intertwining. My heart gave an unexpected leap.

Lately, I've been constantly troubled like this. Yui-san's every move and gesture just keeps stirring up my feelings.

I pulled her hand along, hoping against hope that my feelings wouldn't show through our clasped hands, even though I knew it was pointless to think that.

　Whether we were eating matcha tiramisu or savouring her favourite tea, Yui-san would sit across the table, smiling and watching me.

"Is it nice?"

"It's nice."

I adore that gentle gaze, yet it makes me a little uneasy.\
Sometimes I feel anxious, as if those deep black eyes might peer right into my soul.

　Like she knows everything already. That she understands all my worries and troubles, yet says nothing.

Truthfully, you can only know someone's real feelings by asking them.

I know it's all my fault – this cowardly me, hesitating and dithering, lacking the courage to simply ask, "Please tell me the real reason you don't have a lover."

　When booking the lodgings, I was asked whether I preferred a bed or futon. Without hesitation, I said futon.

After all, when staying at a ryokan is about the only chance I get to sleep on a futon. I didn't know how Yui-san felt about it, but I stuck to my guns. The moment we were shown to our room, I knew I'd made the right choice.

This was probably the first time in my life I'd stayed at such an authentic ryokan, with its traditional Japanese style so prominently featured.

"It's... spacious, isn't it..."

"Yes, it is. Oh, there's a terrace too. And an open-air bath."

The envelope Yukiyasu-san had received from Yui-san, containing the travel voucher, had been quite thick.

"We should make the most of it," Yui-san had said, choosing this luxury inn. It was so expensive that I felt a little intimidated, wondering if it was really right to be receiving such generous hand-me-downs.

　The sun was beginning to set. Stepping outside and sitting down on a chair, the colourful leaves of the trees filling her view were truly beautiful.

"Ah, you can see Mount Fuji."

"You're right."

"Do you think you can see it from the main bath too?"

"If we go in the morning, we might just catch it. They said dinner starts at half past six, so there's no time to go now."

Yui-san said, glancing at her watch. A morning bath sounded lovely too. Indeed, it would be absolutely perfect if we could bathe together, I thought.

Back in the room, we put on the yukata that had been laid out for us. As I fumbled about, Yui-san smiled and neatly tied the obi sash on my yukata for me.

"Yui-san, are you perhaps quite experienced with travelling?"

"Not at all. I've never been on a proper trip. Just taken along on company outings as a child."

"Oh. That sounds nice, that sort of thing."

"Not really. Even when he called it a trip, it was work for Dad, and it wasn't nearly as enjoyable as this."

Yui-san pulled me close and hugged me tightly.

"Your yukata is lovely. I'm so glad I came. We really must thank Yuki-nii."

She kept saying "adorable, adorable" while kissing my cheeks and eyelids, making me feel rather embarrassed.

"Oh, Yui-san, you're squeezing me so tight it's uncomfortable!"

I pushed her shoulders away, trying to hide my blush. Her gentle eyes were fixed on me.

I wondered what kind of expression I must be wearing to Yui-san.

Perhaps I, too, was overflowing with affection in my gaze, just like this.

Then it was time for dinner, and as we were leisurely enjoying our meal in the room, Yui-san had unusually ordered a local beer.

"So you drink beer too, Yui-san? I thought it was just highballs for you."

"Highballs are my favourite, but I basically only drink them at home. I have something different at bars too."

"Oh? What do you drink then?"

"Salty Dogs, for instance."

Huh? Dogs? I never really grasped drink names. What flavour could that be?

"...What exactly is that?"

"It's a cocktail with grapefruit and vodka. The rim of the glass is salted, and that's what makes it so delicious."

"Grapefruit..."

　As I listened, I recalled the first time Yui-san kissed me when she was drunk. I distinctly remember a faint grapefruit flavour.

"Kanata? Your face is red."

"...Nothing. Yui-san, you're going to have a bath soon, so please don't drink too much."

"Aye."

The sashimi was delicious too, and seeing Yui-san in such high spirits made me happy as well.

　Ah, travelling is wonderful, I thought. Of course, I knew. That "who you go with" is the most important thing.

"Kanata, you can go and have a bath first."

After the meal was cleared away, Yui-san said that, and I suddenly felt rather sorry.

It was true I'd stipulated that we should stagger our bathing times, but now I was starting to feel bad about making her wait in the room for over an hour.

"Please go first, Yui-san. It is your birthday celebration, after all."

"Don't worry about it. There's a bath in the room too."

Saying that, Yui-san pointed towards the open-air bath provided in the room.

"But..."

Just as I started to say it was such a special hot spring, Yui-san smiled brightly and peered into my face. Her long black hair swayed softly.

"Well then, let's go in together after all."

"No, no way. I mean, the changing room in the main bath is brightly lit..."

"You don't like it being bright? Then we can just turn off the lights in the room's open-air bath. If you don't want me to see you change, I'll go in first and wait for you."

My feelings wavered. It was true I'd thought it would be wonderful to bathe together. Even now, I found myself thinking it would be a shame to waste this precious time by going in separately.

"Still no?"

Please don't ask so gently. I wish you wouldn't make me choose like this.\
I knew Yui-san would never force me.\
But... well... the desire to be with her outweighed my embarrassment.

"...All right. In that case, I suppose it's fine if we go in together."

Trying to hide my embarrassment, I ended up sounding rather condescending.

"Really? Well, now that's settled, let's get in quickly."

"Eh? Are you sure it's alright without sobering up first?"

"I don't get drunk that easily, so it's fine."

Yui-san smiled happily, making me suddenly feel embarrassed, and I abruptly looked away.

　I'd been so preoccupied with being seen myself, but come to think of it, I was about to see Yui-san naked too.

My heart had been pounding since earlier.

I almost retracted my offer, thinking I should take it back, but then I saw her smiling happily.

I bit my lip tightly and swallowed those words.
