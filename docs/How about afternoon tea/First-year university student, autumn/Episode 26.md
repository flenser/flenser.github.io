Episode 26: Next year, and the year after that, I'll make the same request again

The living room fell silent, just the two of us.

"Um, Yui-san—"

I called out to her retreating figure after seeing Yukiyasu-san off. Yui-san turned around, her brow visibly furrowing.

"Kanata."

Hearing my name, she closed the distance.

"...Why did you unlock the door?"

"Eh?"

"Did you properly check the monitor? You shouldn't just trust some unknown man and open the door."

I hadn't checked the monitor. I'd just woken up, and I thought it was Yui-san. It was undeniably a valid point; I couldn't argue.

"...I'm sorry. I thought it was Yui-san coming home."

　She gently pulled me close to her chest. I could smell Yui-san's sweet scent. It was the reassuring, beloved fragrance I loved.

"It's Yuki-nii's fault, but there were men's shoes by the door, so I was a bit startled."

"I'll make sure to check properly next time."

"Mm, absolutely."

Yui-san hugged me tightly, refusing to let go, and rubbed her face against the back of my neck, tickling me a little.

"Yui-san, really, let go of me. I bought cake, shall we eat it together?"

"Before that, there's something I want to ask you."

"What is it?"

"...How was meeting Yuki-nii? Did you fall for him?"

She says it sulkily, making me chuckle softly. She must know I'm not the type to fall for someone so easily.

"He was more handsome than I imagined, which surprised me... but I'm not the flighty type. Come on, let's cheer up and celebrate. Ritsu-san bought champagne for you, Yui-san."

Yui-san smiled, looking relieved, then gently took my chin. Before I could react, a soft touch graced my lips, and I let her give me a gentle kiss that barely touched.

Lately, Yui-san really has no inhibitions. And I suppose I'm the one accepting it, but still.

"Um... Yui?"

"...I've been wanting to come back for so long. I thought so many times I should have refused today. I wanted to see Kanata."

Hearing her voice of vulnerability for the first time nearly took my breath away.

Being looked at so directly and told that felt like being plunged to the bottom of a deep sea where I couldn't breathe.

　No matter how much I struggled, no matter how much I struggled, it seemed utterly impossible to surface alone.

I too had waited and waited for Yui-san to return. I longed to see her, I longed to see her so terribly.

Overcome by tenderness, I pulled Yui-san tightly back into my embrace.\
I was so happy we could spend this important day together. I couldn't help but pray from the bottom of my heart that she would have a happier year than anyone else in the world.

　Two champagne glasses lined up on the coffee table, and two slices of shortcake. Of course, my glass contained ginger ale. Next year we'll be able to drink the same thing, so this year I'll endure.

"So... what is it you want, Yui?"

She said she'd tell me on the day itself. What could it be? I wanted her to tell me quickly. Staring intently at Yui sitting beside me, her gentle eyes softened and narrowed.

"Since it's such a special occasion, why don't you try guessing?"

"No way. I mean, I've been thinking about it forever, but I really haven't the foggiest."

I resented the fact that this meant I hadn't prepared anything. I knew it was pointless to feel jealous of the faint blue paper bag catching the corner of my eye, but I couldn't help it.

　Noticing my sulk, Yui-san smiled. Then her hand reached out, circled the back of my neck, and pulled me closer.

It was a habit I'd learned from kissing Yui-san several times before – the way she kissed. Feeling the forceful grip of her arm, holding me firmly so I couldn't escape, made my chest burn.

As expected, she silenced my complaints by pressing her lips against mine.

The fact she does this so readily makes me think Yui probably enjoys kissing. It’s a little infuriating how skilled she is, how her experience shows through.

It’s frustrating, but kissing Yui feels good. That’s why I can’t refuse her.

　It's incomparable to anyone I've been with before. I'm always completely at the mercy of those lips.

When our lips parted, Yui stared intently into my eyes and said,

"Do you really want to know what I desire?"

"...I do."

I nodded. Yui gently traced my damp lips with her thumb.

"...I want all of you."

"Eh...?"

All of me? What does that even mean?

I could feel my face burning. I couldn't comprehend the words. What did that mean? My mind spun in confusion.

She took my hand, kissed the back of it softly, and looked at me with mischievous eyes.

"Is that not alright?"

I was pushed down onto the sofa without warning.

No way, wait, seriously? Did you mean to do this from the start? I don't understand. I mean, I haven't even had a bath yet, but that's not the point.

What should I do? We're not even dating, I shouldn't be doing this. Honestly, I don't understand Yui at all anymore.

　Without waiting for my reply, I felt her lips pressed against my neck. After lightly biting down, she sucked with a soft popping sound.

"...Yui-san... w-wait...!"

All I could manage was this feeble, mosquito-like whisper. I squeezed my eyes shut and turned my face away from Yui-san.

　As I desperately pushed away the hands that had somehow become intertwined with mine, I heard Yui-san chuckle softly. Timidly, I opened my eyes.

She was leaning over me, smiling amusedly.

"...You want me to wait until you're mentally prepared? Well then, I'll wait as long as it takes."

Hearing her point that out, I felt my face flush bright red like a boiled octopus. You idiot, why didn't you say "stop" instead of "wait"?

"...Yui, you idiot. This sort of thing is no good. It's against the rules..."

When I said that in a trembling voice, Yui burst out laughing.\
"Sorry, sorry, I startled you, didn't I?" she said, pulling my hand and helping me up.

"You're being mean, teasing me like that..."

　If I'd just accepted it then, what would Yui-san have done?\
I don't know. But I'm sure that look in her eyes wasn't a joke.\
I think she sensed I'd chickened out and pulled back... probably, anyway.

Yui-san gently stroked my puffed-out cheeks. "Sorry, was it scary?" she apologised again. I shook my head side to side.

"I truly want to celebrate with you... I mean it. Please tell me properly. What do you want?"

"...Then, let's start afresh. Will you listen to my real request?"

Just as I thought she'd gently taken my hand, she softly intertwined our little fingers. I thought her smooth, rounded bordeaux nails were incredibly alluring.

"If it's something I can do..."

Still trying to calm my pounding heart, I met her earnest gaze.

"I want you to promise me."

"Promise? It's not a gift?"

"Yes."

Ah, so that's why she said I didn't need to prepare anything.

"...Promise me you'll celebrate my birthday next year too. I'll ask the same thing next year, and the year after that... Promise me each time. No matter what happens, I want you to be the first to say 'Happy Birthday' on this day."

I was taken aback, never expecting that Yui-san would make such a heartfelt request.

"...Is that... really all it takes?"

"Yes."

Seeing Yui smile contentedly, I felt an inexplicable pang of sadness, as if my chest were being squeezed. Why did she want to make such a promise?

　It was as if she believed this relationship would crumble unless she made such promises going forward.

"...I promise. Next year too, I'll be the first to celebrate your birthday, Yui."

As if to dispel my own unease, I met her gaze directly and declared it, refusing to be outdone.\
Yui smiled with genuine happiness and pressed her lips to our linked little fingers.

"...It's a promise, Kanata."

At that moment, with our little fingers entwined, I believed without a shadow of a doubt that I could keep that promise forever — next year, the year after, and far beyond, for as long as she wished.

I should have told her properly.

That night, you said you wanted all of me, but all along, all of me had already been yours alone.
