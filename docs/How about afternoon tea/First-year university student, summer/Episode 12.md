Episode 12: Are They Dating? The Two of Them

On sweltering summer afternoons, iced coffee sells like hot cakes.

The café uniforms switched from long sleeves to short sleeves, and shaved ice appeared on the menu.

Even in summer, regulars still made up the bulk of this shop's clientele, but the cooler the aquarium looked, the more it drew customers in as the outside temperature climbed.

　My favourite is this tiny pufferfish. It's adorable, darting about in the tank. What was its name again? The owner told me, but it was so long I've forgotten.

Watching this little one makes me itch to go to the aquarium with Yui-san soon.

I'm looking forward to it, really can't wait.

Once I got through the exams looming in a few days, summer holidays would be just around the corner.

　Just as I finished feeding the fish, the doorbell chimed. Reflexively, I turned towards the entrance and called out, "Welcome!"

"Kanata-chan, it's been ages."

Appearing in the shop with a lively voice was Ritsu-san, her long pink-ash hair tied back. She was dressed casually in just a tank top with a shirt thrown over it – a look that screamed summer.

"It's been a while, Ritsu-san."

The last time I'd seen Ritsu-san was during the incident with Yui-san getting terribly drunk.\
Why had she gone out of her way to come to the shop today? I guided her to a counter seat and handed her the menu.

"...Um, I'm terribly sorry for all the trouble I caused back then."

"Ah, the running away? It wasn't any trouble at all. I'm just glad you made up."

　I really did wonder how it would turn out. Since then, I've reflected a bit myself – I need to be more careful not to involve others in my actions.

"I'd never seen Yui so panicked before."

"Really?"

When Yui-san came to Yuri's house, she seemed incredibly calm to me. Ritsu-san chuckled softly as she flipped through the menu.

"Oh dear, oh dear," she said, "she was clutching her head the whole time she was looking for Kanata-chan."

I couldn't imagine it. The thought that she'd been so worried made me feel strangely flushed. But that must have been a side of her only Ritsu saw, and I felt a little envious.

　There was definitely a bond between those two. So what exactly was there between me and Yui-san?\
I'd already laid all my weaknesses and flaws bare for Yui-san to see. So surely she could show me a little more of her own vulnerabilities too.

"Ah, this looks good. I'll have the iced coffee and cake set."

"Certainly."

This shop's cold brew coffee was refreshing and delicious.\
　Since Yui-san likes coffee too, I thought I'd get her some next time she comes. That's when I noticed Ritsu-san staring intently at me from across the counter.

"Kanata-chan, you're surprisingly capable when you put your mind to it. I've got to rethink my opinion of you."

"...About what?"

After placing the glasses and cake on the counter, I met her dark brown, drooping eyes. Ritsu-san flashed a sly, defiant grin.

"Not many women would splash water on that Yui, you know."

"...Ritsu-san, how much do you know...?"

"When I asked what on earth she did to make you so angry, she spilled everything. Said she kissed you when she was drunk, then you shoved her away and splashed water on her."

I could feel my cheeks flush hot. Why on earth did Yui just blurt that out so easily? Even if it was Ritsu, having the fact she kissed me out in the open was a bit embarrassing.

"Well, that was... I was startled, and in the heat of the moment..."

"It's fine, just a little. Yui needs to learn a lesson now and then."

I certainly agree with that. Just because someone's popular doesn't mean they have licence to do that sort of thing to anyone. I think it only works if both parties consent.

"So, the reason I came to see you today, Kanata-chan, was because I wanted to confirm a few things."

Ritsu-san takes a bite of her shortcake. She hums contentedly, looking blissfully happy, and it makes me feel a little peckish too. How nice, I want some too.

　Just as I was thinking that, a bombshell of a question came flying at me without mercy.

"Are you two... dating?"

"Eh...?"

The question came from such an unexpected angle, my brain froze. Ritsu-san's eyes were utterly serious, fixed intently on me.

"Dating? Who with? Who exactly?"

"Yui and... Kanata-chan?"

"Wh-why would you think that?"

"Hmm... Didn't Kanata-chan ask the other day how two women do it?"

It was true, that had happened. But it wasn't about Yui-san and me specifically; I'd simply asked out of curiosity about what sex between women generally entailed.

"And then Yui kissed Kanata-chan and they ended up arguing, right?"

"That's true, but..."

"But then you made up and reconciled. I wonder if that means you're dating now?"

Ritsu asked as if it were the most natural thing in the world.

I reckon she doesn't really care that Yui-san is a lesbian, so she's probably just asking out of genuine curiosity, not to tease or anything. Still, my heart had been pounding faster and faster since she asked.

"We're not dating. Besides, Yui-san isn't the type to have girlfriends, is she?"

"Well, I suppose not. You're such a serious type, not really suited to playing around, so why on earth did Yui do that?"

That... I wish I knew myself. Maybe something unpleasant happened, or she was feeling frustrated or something.

I never did find out the real reason why she kissed me.

"...Um, Ritsu-san?"

"Hm? What is it?"

"Ritsu-san, have you ever been kissed by Yui-san or anything?"

It was a genuinely curious question. After all, Ritsu-san had a certain charm, and it seemed unlikely that Yui-san, who was quite fond of women, had never made a move on her.

However, that question was cut off abruptly by Ritsu-san, who looked utterly displeased.

"Of course not. Yui's type is more like Kanata-chan – sweet-faced, very cat-like..."

"Cat-like?"

"Hmm, no, never mind. Sorry, forget I said that."

Ritsu laughed nervously, making me tilt my head. True, Yui had once said I resembled an unaccustomed cat, but I didn't think I had a cat-like face.

"Mind if I ask? You don't have to answer if you don't want to, but... are you attracted to men? Or women?"

"Men."

"...I figured. Never mind. Anyway, if you ever need anything, just get in touch."

With that, Ritsu hurried off, saying she had to study for her exams. My heart was still beating strangely, thump-thump.

　Whether we were dating or not. It would be rather embarrassing if it was seen as a lovers' quarrel.

When I ran away from home, Yuri said nothing when I asked to stay at hers.

But when I next saw her at university, I thought I should make it clear, just in case, that we weren't in a romantic relationship.

＊＊＊

When I got home from my part-time job, Yui-san seemed to have just returned too. She was taking off her necklace, her hand around the back of her neck.

"I'm home."

"Ah, welcome back, Kanata."

A single-stone diamond necklace sparkled brightly, reflecting the living room light.

Something I've noticed recently.

Yui-san changes her nails and earrings on a whim, yet she always wears the same necklace.

The one thing the fickle Yui-san has treasured for so long. There's something special about that necklace that I just can't stop thinking about.

　Settling onto the sofa, I glanced at my watch. It was just past eight. No wonder I was hungry.

"Hey, Yui, I'm starving."

Saying this in a slightly whiny voice, Yui glanced at me as she took off her watch.

The watch she tossed onto the jewellery tray was different from yesterday's. Still, only the necklace remained consistently the same.

"Haven't you eaten anything? Shall we order something then?"

The way she phrased it suggested Yui-san had eaten before coming home.

We usually have breakfast together, but dinner is often separate. We eat together if our schedules align, but I often work part-time in the evenings too.

Standing beside the sofa, she was swiping her finger swiftly across her smartphone. She must be searching for something on a delivery app, but I wasn't in the mood for that today.

"...Yui, make something."

At that, her hand stopped abruptly. Yui looked at me wide-eyed, puzzled.

"What's up? Feeling clingy today? Something happen?"

"Nothing really, but delivery takes time."

"That hungry?"

　Asked, I gave a slight nod. I was hungry, yes, but more than that, I suddenly had this overwhelming urge to eat something Yui-san had made.\
Saying it out loud was fine, but I did wonder if she might refuse. She'd just got back and must be tired, and maybe it was just too selfish of me, I thought.

"Alright, fine."

She said it so simply, and headed for the kitchen, so I hurriedly followed behind her.

"Um... Are you sure it's alright?"

After opening the fridge to check the ingredients, Yui-san turned back to me.

"I reckon I could manage pasta, is that alright?"

"I love pasta."

"Really? That's good."

Seeing Yui-san, who hadn't rested once since coming home, pull out a pot and start cooking efficiently, I felt terribly guilty for being so selfish.

"...Um, is there anything I can help with?"

"You're hungry, aren't you? You could just sit down."

Why is she so kind? Well, I knew she was, but... Even so, I couldn't just sit and wait. Yui-san said with a laugh.

"Right then, make me a highball. There are glasses at the back."

Turning around, I spotted the glasses Yui-san always used when she drank. According to her, she liked her whisky and sparkling water three parts to one.

I made a mental note to remember that.

　While the pasta boiled, she deftly chopped ingredients and tossed them into the frying pan. It struck me again: this person really has been cooking for herself all this time.

Snapping out of my fascination, I remembered the task at hand. I filled the glass with ice and poured in the soda water and whisky at a three-to-one ratio.

Earlier, when I’d tried to measure precisely with a measuring cup, she’d said it didn’t need to be exact. Still, I worried whether I’d got it right.

"Get the lemon from the fridge. It's already sliced, so just pop it in and you're done."

I placed the lemon as instructed. Handing it to Yui-san, with its faintly grown-up aroma, she smiled brightly and said thank you.

"Right then, cheers!"

I was offered a glass, but I had nothing to clink with, so I hastily grabbed a measuring cup nearby and clinked it against the glass.\
Every time she gulped down the drink, her white throat moved, and I thought it looked strangely alluring.

"Is it that delicious?"

"It's delicious. When will you be able to drink, Kanata?"

"I turn twenty next April."

"Eh, April? But your birthday's already passed this year. Why didn't you tell me?"

"Don't people usually keep that to themselves? When's your birthday, Yui-san?"

"Mine's in October."

Beep, beep, beep. The timer sounded. With practised hands, she drained the pasta and tossed a single portion into the frying pan. The ingredients were bacon and king oyster mushrooms. Both were meant to be Yui-san's snacks. The delicious aroma of butter and soy sauce made my stomach growl loudly.

"Here you go."

I was moved by the pasta placed on the dining table. I properly clasped my hands together and said, "Itadakimasu," to which Yui-san smiled directly in front of me and replied, "Enjoy your meal."

"Was this slapdash stuff really alright?"

"It's delicious."

"Really? Well, I'm glad then... I'm not really sure myself. I've never eaten home-cooked food before."

She'd mentioned before that her father couldn't cook either, and Yui-san's words about never having tasted home cooking sounded somehow lonely.

"...I'd like you to make it again sometime."

"Sure. If I've got all the right ingredients, I can make something a bit more proper for you."

Pasta was perfectly fine, though. Yui watched me devour the pasta with a smile the whole time, probably because I was so hungry.

"...Your exams finish next Friday, right? Shall we go to the aquarium on Saturday?"

I'd been looking forward to it for ages, so I nodded immediately.\
I hadn't felt this excited when I went to the zoo with Hayakawa-kun, yet now my heart was pounding with anticipation.

Please, let it be sunny. Yes, I couldn't help but wish for it.
