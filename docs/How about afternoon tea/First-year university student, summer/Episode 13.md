Episode 13: Today, I'll let you off the hook

The first weekend after exams brought the clear, refreshing skies I'd wished for – perfect weather for an outing.

Saturday, the day of our promise.

An hour and a half's drive. Crossing right through the middle of Tokyo Bay, we set foot on the Bōsō Peninsula for the first time. My heart leapt at the thought of the long-awaited aquarium.

　Clutching the pamphlet handed to us with the tickets, I checked the show times and tugged Yui-san's hand, urging her along.

"Yui-san, let's hurry and see the orcas!"

"Eh? Are we going to the show first?"

"But it says it starts at half nine. Since we're here, I want to see that first."

"...Kanata, are you the type who eats taiyaki from the head end?"

Asking that means Yui-san must be the type who eats from the tail end. I can't resist and always eat my favourite part first.

"...Is that not allowed?"

"It's not forbidden. Right then, let's go see it first."

The hand I'd been tugging gently clasped mine again, and we headed straight for the stadium.

　We'd arrived well before the show was due to start, yet people were already staking out spots here and there. Still, we managed to secure the very front row.

I handed Yui the raincoat I'd bought and prepared beforehand.

"Eh? Are we wearing these? Won't it be hot?"

"I heard we're going to get absolutely soaked."

"Huh, really?"

She looked sceptical, but I'd done my research beforehand, so I wasn't taking any chances.

"Doubting me? Well then, you don't have to wear yours, Yui-san. It's not me who'll be in trouble."

As I said this and reached out to take back the raincoat, Yui-san deftly dodged my hand.

"...I'll wear it. Just in case."

Perhaps noticing other front-row patrons putting on raincoats too, Yui quietly slipped her arms through the sleeves.

"Ah, mind your shoes too, please."

At that, Yui's gaze fell to her two-tone sneakers, resembling orca dolphins.

"Eh... Is it really that bad? Maybe I should've worn sandals like Kanata."

　I smiled at Yui, who seemed just a little timid now, and pressed my shoulder firmly against hers.

Today, Yui was dressed casually for easy driving – a refreshing change.

Though honestly, she always looks beautiful, whatever she wears, thanks to her great figure.

The earrings peeking through her glossy black hair caught the sunlight and sparkled. Lovely, I thought.

　I'd been looking forward to today for so very long, which is why I managed to buckle down for my exams.

My first summer holiday spent with Yui-san. Though, since I'm returning to England next week, this will probably be my only summery event.

When I mentioned coming back at the end of August, Yui-san told me some places still have fireworks displays then.

　I stole a glance at her beside me.

This girl, so incredibly popular she can't help it, must surely have her schedule packed with dates.\
Everyone wants her. Even knowing she'll never belong to anyone, I could understand the urge to reach out for her now.

I don't know anyone else as captivating as Yui-san.

The first killer whale I'd ever seen was far larger than I'd imagined.

　Its black and white bulk surged up from the depths, leaping lightly amid cheers.

Just when you thought it had jumped high enough, it slammed its body hard against the surface. With a thunderous splash, a torrent of water, more than I'd imagined, came crashing down from above without mercy.

Spray flew up into the blue sky, sparkling as it reflected the sun.

Ah, I thought, it's been ages since I felt a Japanese summer like this.

　When the spectators' cries, more akin to screams than cheers, finally subsided. Despite wearing raincoats, both of us were thoroughly soaked through.

"Blimey, that was something else, wasn't it? I'm gobsmacked!"

Yui laughed innocently, brushing her damp fringe back.

"Are you alright?"

"I'm fine. I'm used to getting splashed with water."

I nudged Yui's arm with my elbow as she peered at my face with a mischievous grin.

The sun was out, so it would probably dry in no time.

　She wiped my face with a handkerchief, tickling me.

"...It's salty."

"Are you alright?"

I'd licked the droplets that had splashed onto my face, and they were salty. The extreme saltiness made me involuntarily stick out my tongue, and Yui laughed.

"There's a dolphin and seal show too, so we need to move on soon."

"Do the dolphins and seals splash water too?"

"Only the killer whales do that. And only in summer. That's why I wanted to come."

Taking Yui-san's hand, I tugged her along, urging her to hurry. As she stood up, she looked at me and smiled softly.

"...You really are cute."

"Wh-what do you mean?"

"Nothing. Come on, next is the dolphins, right?"

She started walking, pulling my joined hand along.

　My face felt hot, surely just the sun's fault, definitely.

After watching the dolphin and sea lion show and feeling thoroughly satisfied, we strolled leisurely around the indoor exhibits.

The lighting was dim inside, and getting separated would be terrible, so I squeezed her fingers tightly, afraid our loosely intertwined grip might slip apart. Yui-san smiled gently.

　I'm weak for Yui-san's smile like this. Why does she look at me with such gentle eyes?

My heart feels like it's being squeezed tight.

We sit side by side on chairs in front of the large jellyfish tank. I could watch their floating forms forever.

"I haven't been to many aquariums, but this is fun. I might get hooked."

"Don't you usually go on dates or something?"

"I don't have anyone to go on dates with."

She squeezed her hand tightly, almost digging her nails in.

"Ouch, ouch!"

"But you must have plenty of people you could go out with."

"That's not true. It's only you I'd go on a date with."

She whispered those words, sweet as sugar, softly into my ear, so I couldn't help but glare at her.

　I know. She must say the same thing to everyone.

"Is this a date?"

"I intended it to be. Was it different for you, Kanata?"

She said that, her gaze lingering maliciously on our joined hands. Suddenly embarrassed, I pulled my hand away, and our grip came apart with surprising ease.

"There's no need to be embarrassed."

"...Yui-san, I never said it was a date. Didn't you say you were taking me out as an 'apology'?"

"Did I?"

"...Honestly, you're so smooth."

I stood up and started walking, Yui-san following behind me.

　Being with this person feels comfortable because everything — my walking pace, everything — is perfectly matched to mine.

I first noticed it when I went out with Hayakawa-kun. I thought maybe men just walked faster, but that wasn't it. Yui-san had been matching her pace to mine.

"Getting hungry? Shall we go to a restaurant?"

Yui-san caught up beside me and gently took my right hand. Our fingertips intertwined.

　I wanted to ask her, how did you know? Could Yui-san actually read my mind?

It felt like she was using magic.

We spent the whole day exploring the aquarium, and as an apology, she even bought me an orca plushie – it was a thoroughly satisfying day.

　Getting into the car, I placed the plushie on my lap. The cold air conditioning breeze that blew out the moment the engine started felt wonderfully refreshing.

"Today was absolutely brilliant."

"I'm glad. If you'd just said, I'd take you anywhere. The aquarium, the zoo, the amusement park."

"...Isn't this a bother?"

"Not at all."

Yui-san's hand squeezed mine tightly. Even though we'd been holding hands all day, being alone in the car and having her take my hand like this suddenly made me feel rather embarrassed.

"Does this mean... you've forgiven me?"

Yui-san looked at me, as if trying to read my expression. I’d told her she didn’t need to apologise for kissing me, but come to think of it, I hadn’t actually said I forgave her.

I’d forgiven her ages ago and completely forgotten about it.

Had she been worried about it all this time?

"I’m not angry anymore. …Honestly, I feel almost guilty about all you’ve done for me. I had such a wonderful time today."

She’d driven us, bought the tickets, even given me a stuffed toy.

　To be honest, when you ask if my lips are worth all this, I do wonder if it’s too much.

Gently, the fingers we’d been holding came apart. That hand reached out smoothly and stroked my cheek softly.

Those eyes, as deep as the night sea, captured me and wouldn’t let go.

“I had fun too.”

　Her thumb gently traced my lips. Blood rushed to my heart with a thud, making it pound wildly.\
When she gazed at me like that, I almost forgot to breathe.\
She was too beautiful. Like drowning, I couldn't draw air.

"...Kanata."

She called my name. The sound resonating in my eardrums was far sweeter and gentler than usual.

　Please, don't call me with such a gentle voice.\
Don't look at me like that, as if you can't bear to be apart from me.

Her hand came around the back of my neck, pulling me closer. Yui leaned forward, closing the distance.

I knew instinctively she was going to kiss me.

Why? There was no time to think about such things. It felt as natural as breathing.

　Just as my eyes were about to close naturally, it happened. At the very moment our lips were mere centimetres apart, a ringtone suddenly sounded.

Yui-san froze instantly.

The sound wasn't from my phone. A name appeared on the car's satnav. An incoming call for Yui-san.

Shinji Kitakami. A man's name I'd never seen before.

The instant she saw that name, Yui-san sighed wearily.

　She reached out and tapped the navigation system's 'Off' button with a sharp click.

As Yui tried to close the distance again, I regained a little composure and pressed the orca figurine from my lap against her face to stop her.

"...Kanata."

I smiled slightly at the dissatisfied voice I heard through the orca.

"Aren't you going to answer that call?"

"That was someone from work. It's Saturday today, so no need to answer. I'll call them back later."

"Even so... trying to kiss on the first date? Yui, you're moving too fast."

Ignoring how I'd nearly been swept up in the moment myself, I looked at her reproachfully.\
Honestly, it was really close. My heart was still pounding.

"...Then when would be okay?"

"Is that how you see it? Oh, you haven't learnt your lesson at all... Do you even mean to apologise?"

I prayed the evening sun streaming through the window would hide my flushed cheeks.

"...Really, no?"

"...No."

If I let her kiss me now, I probably wouldn't be able to refuse her again.\
　I was a little scared. Scared of a door I didn't even know existed being forced open, scared of losing my nerve.

Yui-san had been staring intently at me, but she sighed softly, perhaps giving up. I felt a little tickled, thinking she didn't need to be so disappointed.

Even though she's done far more than just kissed all sorts of girls.

She says I'm special to her, but I don't know how many people that 'special' applies to for Yui-san.

"Right... I see."

Just as I thought she'd gently taken my hand, she gave my knuckles a soft peck.

Stunned, I just stared blankly at the scene. Yui-san chuckled softly.

"...I'll let you off with that today."

Hearing that, my face flushed scarlet. Realising this couldn't be hidden by the sunset, I hurriedly looked away.

"Right, shall we head back?"

Yui-san took hold of the steering wheel as if nothing had happened.

My heartbeat refused to slow as the car began driving towards home.

　Next week, I have to return to England, to my family.

Just three weeks. But how many women will this person kiss, how many nights will she spend with them, in that time?

Just thinking about it, I could feel a thick, sticky emotion settling deep in my chest.

I couldn't even remember how I'd lived before meeting Yui-san.

To think I didn't want to be apart for even a moment... surely, I must be mad.
