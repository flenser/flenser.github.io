Episode 14: Don't Say Such Cute Things

"Lucky there was a direct flight from Haneda. If it'd been Narita, we might've had to stay overnight beforehand."

Early morning. Yui chuckled as she stuffed my suitcase into the car boot.

　My luggage consisted of a few changes of clothes and an orca plush toy. "You're taking that? Won't it take up space?" Yui-san asked, but I ignored her and crammed it into the suitcase.

The orca had to come. I'd feel lonely without something to hug when I missed her.

August arrived in the blink of an eye, and before I knew it, it was departure day.

　This Japanese summer, I shall bid farewell for a while to the sound of cicadas.

After loading the luggage, Yui opened the passenger door for me, so I climbed into her beloved car.\
I never know when she washes it, but Yui's car is always gleaming. Perhaps it's thanks to having a garage.

That car, apparently a hand-me-down from her brother, is a bit of a stretch for a university student to drive, but it suits Yui perfectly.

　Apparently, "Yuki-nii loves cars, so he replaces his every three years."

The car began its gentle journey towards the airport. Travelling by train with such heavy luggage would be a nightmare.\
I silently thanked Yui-san's brother, whom I'd never even met.

When I first returned to Japan, I was so homesick and lonely I couldn't bear it. Now, I find myself wanting to stay here just a little longer.

　This shift in feeling was undoubtedly down to the person sitting to my right.

I gazed at Yui-san's profile, illuminated by the morning sun.\
It was when she took me to the aquarium recently that I realised how much I liked the sight of her profile while driving, and the way her hands gripped the steering wheel.

Had I been in Japan, she surely would have taken me to so many more places.\
Time pressed on relentlessly. I adore my father, mother, and brother, but right now...

"...I don't want to go back."

I muttered that quietly, and Yui-san smiled.

"Why? London's cooler than Japan, isn't it? Summers should be more bearable over here."

"That's not the point. It's my first Japanese summer in ages, and I didn't even get to see any fireworks."

"There are fireworks displays in late August too. Want to go together when you get back?"

"...Is that alright?"

"Yes, promise."

University summer holidays are long. Using the excuse that I couldn't take that much time off work, I told my parents I'd only be back for three weeks.

Air tickets aren't cheap either. I know that, but I want to enjoy my university summer holiday too.

I want to go all sorts of places. With Yui-san, just the two of us. Like that aquarium the other day.

　I'll miss her when we're apart, but I wonder how Yui-san feels. Maybe she's happy to have some quiet time alone again after so long.

I kept staring at that beautiful profile, completely unable to tell what she was thinking.

If only she were a bit easier to read. This clever person is also incredibly skilled at hiding her feelings; you have to concentrate like you're playing spot the difference to figure out what she really means.

　When Yui noticed me lost in thought and silent, she asked gently, "What's the matter?" I hastily shook off my thoughts.

"...What would you like as a souvenir?"

"Hmm... What's London famous for?"

"Tea... but I've loads at home..."

"True, you do have plenty. Anything's fine, really?"

　The teas I collect for afternoon tea are always stocked in the kitchen. Besides, Yui-san is a coffee person, so she probably wouldn't be thrilled with tea anyway.

There's plenty of time, I decided. I'd take my time looking for something she might like after we got back.

Haneda Airport was closer than I'd thought, and we arrived before I'd had a chance to gather my thoughts. It felt so bittersweet that I briefly wished we'd gone to Narita instead.

When we arrived at the car park, Yui-san took my suitcase out of the boot. The time to part was drawing ever nearer.

"How long does it take to get to London?"

"About half a day, I suppose..."

Back in March this year, when I first met Yui-san, it was also at Haneda Airport.

Back then, I was filled with anxiety, agonising right up until boarding the plane about whether leaving my family behind had been the right choice, whether choosing a Japanese university had been the right choice.

　Even if I regretted it, there was no going back on a decision already made.

I was terribly anxious at first about whether I could get along with Yui-san.\
My father had said confidently, "She's my best friend's daughter, so you'll definitely hit it off," but living with someone outside my family was a first for me.

Looking back now, it was a needless worry.

　At first, having heard she was the daughter of the president of the renowned Ichinose Holdings, I'd imagined some stereotypical young lady.

But when she appeared at the airport, she defied my expectations in every way.

I'd thought, being a wealthy young lady, she'd be wearing a dress and perhaps have someone accompanying her? But no matter how much I scanned the airport, there was no one like that anywhere.

　When I called out, a woman in a black cap waved at me, and I remember being utterly taken aback.\
Yes, I recall she wore the same trainers when we visited the aquarium recently. The white and black Nike ones.

Despite her casual attire, her glossy long black hair and sharply defined features were so perfectly proportioned that I thought, I've never seen such a beauty.

　She arrived in a black luxury car, which she said was hand-me-down from her brother, without even a driver. She looked nothing like I'd imagined; frankly, she seemed rather wild.

Her nails were jet black too, at the time.

Looking back now, I realise first impressions can be quite accurate.

But honestly, I couldn't tell at all that she liked women.

　Once we'd checked in and were finally free of baggage, I suddenly felt restless.\
Time seemed to fly by incredibly fast when I was with Yui-san.

I really must go now. But I don't want to leave her.

I stopped in front of the security checkpoint and turned back to look at Yui-san.\
This is as far as you can come to see me off. You can't go beyond this point, Yui-san.

　I gently took her hand and looked up at her. Those intensely gentle black eyes were fixed on me.

Why, I wonder? Right now, I desperately want to hold her.\
Even though I know I can't do that in public.

"...I'll call you."

"Mm."

"Please answer. Don't ignore it."

"I wouldn't do that."

"Even if you're with a girl? Will you prioritise my call?"

"Of course I will."

"...Please contact me occasionally too, Yui-san."

"Of course I will."

"………………I really don't want to go back."

I knew I was saying something troublesome. Yui-san smiled and gently stroked my cheek with her free hand.

"...Kanata, don't say such adorable things. It makes me not want to let you go at all."

As if admonishing me for not wanting to let go, she squeezed my hand tightly.

"...When you come back to Japan, I'll come and pick you up again. Take care, alright?"

My nod came at the same moment her hand released mine.

"Off you go."

"Right then."

Reluctant to part, I waved repeatedly, looking back over my shoulder.

There's a time difference, so if it's night in Japan, it's daytime over there. Still, I'll call. Absolutely.

Please don't play with other girls while I'm away. I know I have no right to say such a thing, but I couldn't help wishing it.

The aeroplane takes off, leaving Japan behind. As it climbed higher and pierced through the clouds, I felt an overwhelming longing for Yui-san.

It's strange. We've only just parted, yet I already want to see her again.

I bump my head against the aeroplane window.

I've definitely been acting odd lately. Perhaps I've lost my mind.

I don't know the reason. I can't understand it.

Because no one tells me what to call this feeling.
