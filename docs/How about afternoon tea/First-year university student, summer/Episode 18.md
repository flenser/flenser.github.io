Episode 18: So, shall we do it after the fireworks?

If my memory serves me correctly, I had promised Yui-san we'd "go see the fireworks" this weekend.

And yet, here we are now, standing in the rotary of a luxury hotel.

The name "Ichinose" at the entrance made me realise immediately this was one of the hotels run by Yui-san's father.

　Handing the car keys to the hotel attendant who greeted us, Yui beckoned me over with a quick wave. I’d thought we were just using the car park, but she urged me to hurry.

"We’re going to see the fireworks, right? Why the hotel…?"

"You’re hungry, aren’t you? Let’s eat first, then watch the fireworks."

"From here?"

"Yes, you can see them perfectly."

I let myself be led along by the arm around my waist. The sleek floor reflected the lavish orange lighting, and looking up at the ceiling, it seemed to stretch endlessly high.

With every step, the click-clack of my heels echoed, making it feel just like a castle.

"Wait here a moment," she said, and I obediently sat down on a luxurious-looking sofa.

　After Yui-san spoke at the front desk with a rather imposing man with slicked-back hair who emerged from the back, she returned.

"Right, let's go."

"I only came in a regular dress... Is the dress code alright?"

"It's a private room, so don't worry about it."

"A private room...?"

Pulled by the hand, we stepped into the large central lift. Without hesitation, she pressed the button for the fortieth floor, and we ascended rapidly, as if being sucked skyward.

"There are some seats we don't usually use. Private rooms for entertaining clients."

The lift reached the fortieth floor sooner than expected. Still tense, I followed Yui-san to a two-seater table by the window, where a breathtaking night view unfolded. I couldn't help but gasp.

The waiter pulled out my chair and I sat down.

"Sato-san, it's been an age."

"It certainly has. I was looking forward to seeing you, as you haven't been here recently."

Yui-san smiled warmly and addressed the waitress. Mid-thirties, perhaps? A beautiful woman.

She stood upright before the table and gave a crisp, formal bow. Honestly, I'm not used to this sort of thing; it makes me feel a bit flustered.

"I shall be attending to you today. My name is Sato. Aosawa-san, I look forward to serving you."

"I, I look forward to it too..."

Being brought to places like this really drives home how much of a proper young lady Yui-san is. At home, she just seems like a normal older sister, but here she's so at ease, so... seasoned, I suppose.

After ordering drinks, just as Sato-san left the private room, I relaxed my shoulders a little and leaned back in my chair. Yui-san smiled.

"There's no need to be so tense."

"You're used to this sort of thing, aren't you, Yui-san?"

"We have a monthly dinner party, you see."

I see. So the "dinner parties" Yui-san always talks about are held in hotel restaurants like this.

"The fireworks start at half past seven, so we've got two hours. Let's take our time eating."

"When you said we'd see the fireworks, I thought we'd just be looking up from the ground."

"I really wanted to do that too, but the viewing area tickets were sold out, I'm sorry. Next year I'll book somewhere closer, so just bear with it here this year."

Bear with it... well, it actually feels like a massive upgrade to me. Seeing fireworks in such a relaxed setting like this is probably a once-in-a-lifetime thing, but is this just normal for her?

"Actually, I'm delighted. It's my first time..."

"I'm glad to hear it," Yui-san smiled gently, facing me.

"I rather like this restaurant, you know. The chef's a bit of a scary one, though. Once, when I was younger, Yuki-nii and I tried sneaking into the kitchen and got grabbed by the scruff of the neck and told off terribly. But the food really is absolutely delicious."

The image of that mischievous-looking brother and sister came to mind, and I couldn't help but smile. So Yui-san had such an innocent time too.

"...Course meals make me nervous."

"Really? Just eat whatever comes out in order. Table manners don't need to be perfect. There's only the two of us here now."

Even as she said this, Yui-san's impeccable table manners were evident, hinting at her refined upbringing. She really is a young lady, after all.

The French course we'd left entirely to the chef's discretion was utterly delicious, every single dish. I genuinely thought my cheeks might fall off. The dessert and the tea afterwards were absolutely splendid too.

Honestly, I started to feel a little anxious about how much this dinner might cost. How much money did I actually have in my wallet?

"Right, it's just about the right time. Shall we go?"

"...Eh? Aren't we watching it here?"

Having just finished eating, I was wondering why we were moving when I asked, and Yui-san promptly produced a card key.

"I've booked a room."

"Eh...? A room? At the hotel?"

"Yes, the Royal Suite. Top floor."

It suddenly clicked. So that shiny, slicked-back hair at reception had been handing her a room key.

Wait, hold on. This is a hotel. Booking a room means... staying the night?

　I felt my face growing hot. Yui-san before me was smiling coolly. What on earth was she playing at? I had no clue.

"...Um—"

Just as I was about to ask, Yui-san glanced at her watch and stood up.

"Come on, we'd better hurry or it'll start."

"Ah, the bill?"

"The bill? We don't need to pay that."

With that, she took my hand. I called out to Sato-san, "Thank you for the meal," and she smiled broadly and bowed. Truly, we left the restaurant without paying the bill and pressed the up button on the lift.

"The fireworks look absolutely stunning."

Holding up the room key, she pressed the button marked 'Royal Suite' and the iron box ascended once more.

"Um, Yui-san?"

"Hmm?"

"Are we staying tonight?"

"I'd like to say we could go home, but... I've had a drink. Can't drive, so I can't go home."

She smiled mischievously. This was deliberate, absolutely. I pinched her arm hard, and Yui-san laughed again, saying it hurt.

"So that means..."

"What?"

I grabbed her arm and urged her to bend down slightly. As if sharing a secret, I brought my lips close to her ear, where her piercing sparkled.\
Even in the lift, there should be security... well, I couldn't be sure if the audio was being monitored. I whispered as quietly as possible.

"You mean... you want to do naughty things...?"

　Being taken to a hotel, I could only think of that. Just as Yui burst out laughing, the lift reached the top floor.

"What's that? Are you asking me out?"

"N-no. That's not what I meant..."

Stifling her laughter, Yui gently guided my flushed back, urging me to step out of the lift.

　She waved her card key again, and we arrived. Beyond that opulent door. The moment I stepped into the room, a gasp of wonder escaped me. The entire living room was glass-fronted, and the night view captured my heart and wouldn't let go.

In the distance, the sea shrouded in darkness came into view. It bore a certain resemblance to Yui-san's image.

The gentle arms that softly embraced me from behind as I stood transfixed in the living room by the overwhelming scenery. Yui-san's sweet scent tickled deep within my chest, making me feel all tingly.

"Hey, if it really were okay, I wouldn't be thinking about fireworks at all right now."

Her breath tickled my ear as she softly nibbled my earlobe. I turned my face away, resisting. "No, that's not it. I was just wondering what you were really up to."

"Oh, that's cruel. Getting me all worked up like that."

"Yui, what about the fireworks? Look, there's only ten minutes left."

　I lifted my left wrist, where my watch sat, holding it up before Yui-san's eyes. Only ten minutes left; the launch time was fast approaching.

"So then, after the fireworks end, shall we?"

"...Even after the fireworks end, it's no good. I don't do that sort of thing with people I'm not dating."

After stating that clearly, Yui-san quietly moved away from me, looking disappointed. I really don't understand what this person is thinking.\
　When she pressed me about whether we could or couldn't get intimate, I managed to dodge the question so skilfully.

"...What a shame. Right then, I'll just watch the fireworks quietly."

Yui-san settled onto the sofa positioned to see the night view and handed me the room service menu lying on the coffee table.

"They'll deliver until ten o'clock, so you can choose whatever you fancy to eat or drink."

"Are you sure it's alright?"

"Of course. After all, it's on my father's tab."

Yui-san smiled brightly as she said this.

"I asked to borrow the suite because I wanted to watch the fireworks with you. So this is all a present from my father to you."

"I... I feel terribly indebted, having you do all this for me."

"He mentioned that your father really looked after him when he was younger."

"When I visited home, my father mentioned helping your father court your mother."

"Really? Dad certainly doesn't seem the type who's good at courting women."

Strange, I thought. Yui-san is a genius at courting women. Perhaps that devilish charm is inherited from her mother?

"...I hope the fireworks look beautiful."

"Yes, I hope so..."

I settled onto the sofa too, staring intently at the night view. It was already this beautiful just like this. Knowing it would start in a few minutes, my heart began to beat steadily with anticipation.

"...Hey, Kanata. Why are you sitting so far away?"

Because the sofa is just so incredibly spacious, I almost said, but stopped myself. The sofa in Yui-san's living room was about the same size, so that excuse wouldn't fly.

　Perhaps noticing the space I'd left between us, Yui-san stared intently at me, settled at the very edge.

"...Well, it's just..."

Sitting so close in such a lovely room felt... well, it felt like something lovers would do.

I lowered my gaze, not wanting her to see my face, and heard Yui-san chuckle softly.

"Are you embarrassed? How sweet. I won't do anything, come over here."

I closed the distance to her as she called me in that gentle voice. Gently, her arm drew me closer, her hand resting on my shoulder. Yui dimmed the room lights with the remote.

"What's this arm doing?"

"It's what I always do, isn't it? There's no need to be embarrassed."

　Silence was shattered as a streak of light shot up into the pitch-black canvas of the night sky. I gasped involuntarily. A huge bloom blossomed in the air. A moment later, a loud boom echoed.

It was more beautiful than I could have imagined, and I almost forgot to breathe.

"...Amazing."

A quintessential Japanese summer tradition. Fireworks are incredible. I thought to myself, I've never experienced such a wonderful night before.

One after another, they shot up into the sky. I lost track of time, mesmerised, watching them endlessly.

"The fireworks are so beautiful..."

"Yes, they are."

The fireworks at the end of summer held a certain poignancy, tightening my chest. Once August ended, autumn would be just around the corner.

Next year, I want to try handheld sparklers too. I didn't get to do the incense sparklers this year. I'm so glad I came back to Japan. I truly mean it.

　Wanting to express my gratitude, I turned towards Yui-san.

"Yui-san, next year too..."

I wanted to say I wanted to watch them together, but the words faltered. In the distance, a firework boomed. Its light illuminated Yui-san's long lashes and pale cheeks.

I felt the soft touch of her lips, and only a moment later did I realise she was kissing me.

　I thought I'd missed the last firework, but I couldn't push her shoulders away.

Our lips parted with a faint smacking sound. She stared at me intently. I knew I should be angry, but no such emotion stirred within me.

"Um... Yui-san...?"

"Did you dislike it?"

"...Asking after doing it feels rather underhand. You said earlier you wouldn't do anything..."

"Sorry, I couldn't help myself. You're so cute, Kanata."

Yui-san lowered her eyebrows apologetically. Seeing that expression, I couldn't say a word.\
Her arm remained around my shoulder while her other fingers gently wiped my lips. As if reading my anxiety about being pushed down, Yui-san smiled softly.

"I don't do this sort of thing with anyone but my boyfriend..."

"Yeah, I know. I won't go any further. But please, just let me kiss you. Please."

Saying that, she drew her face closer to mine. I knew I had to refuse.

My arms, which should have pushed her away, wouldn't obey me.

Our eyes met at point-blank range. Knowing I wouldn't refuse, Yui gave a soft smile.

　I'd never seen that colour in her eyes before. Beneath the gentleness, a predatory desire flickered.

Unable to bear it, I gently closed my eyes. Her lips touched mine softly.

The arms pulling me closer, the lustrous black hair caressing my neck – everything made me acutely aware that I was kissing a woman.

I hadn't known. A woman's lips were this soft, this pleasurable.

　As lips touched mine again and again, shifting angles, my arms clung to her like a child seeking comfort – beyond my own control.

Inside me, I thought I heard the sound of something crashing down, shattering.
