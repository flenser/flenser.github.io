Episode 77: When are you going to make it up to me? Tonight?

Birthdays are that one special day that comes but once a year. On a certain holiday afternoon, with Yui-san's birthday — the tenth of October — just around the corner, I sat alone in a café, my head in my hands.

It was enough to make one sigh. I'd been full of enthusiasm about making Yui-san's birthday — after four long years — the best day ever, but already I'd hit a wall.

　I couldn't decide on a present for Yui. My steps, light when I left home that morning, now felt as though lead weights were attached to them.

I'd decided from the start that the present would be a necklace.
I placed my hand over my own chest. There, the necklace Yui had given me sparkled.
Because she gave me this one, Yui hasn't been wearing a necklace lately. That's why I thought I'd give her a new one for her birthday.

　That was why, on this holiday, I'd come alone by train to buy a present.
I'd looked online, of course, but you really can't tell without seeing the actual item.
Thinking that, I'd visited several shops since morning, but I just couldn't find anything that seemed quite right for Yui-san's neck.

So now, tired from walking, I'm taking a break in a café.

　The summer bonus I received after joining Yui's company was the highest I'd ever been paid.
Naturally, I hadn't touched a penny of it. I knew autumn would bring Yui's birthday.
There's no such thing as a budget for a present. It doesn't matter how much it costs. More than that, I absolutely refuse to compromise. Because Yui will surely treasure it forever. That's why I want to give her the one thing that suits her best.
It's the first present since we became lovers.

　I absolutely would find a wonderful necklace. Just as Yui-san had given to me, I would give to her.

I gave my cheek a light pat and stood up. There was no point dawdling here.
I returned the tray with the teacup to the return counter, steeled myself, and left the café.

　I didn't want to waste today, a day I'd secured by turning down a holiday date. Truth be told, I hadn't been able to go on a proper date with Yui-san for quite some time. And it seemed she was rather unhappy about it.
She still didn't know – though it was only natural – that I'd turned down her invitation to stay over at the weekend, and that I'd been poring over date plans late into the night.

Because when I'm with Yui, I simply can't spare the energy to think about anything else.
So I thought I needed to physically distance myself to think things through properly. It's for Yui's sake. That's what I thought, but apparently Yui has been complaining to Ritsu about me turning down dates.

　Last night, Ritsu messaged me saying, "Yui's sulking," which made me chuckle a bit.
It's a secret that I secretly saved the photo attached to the message – a picture of my dear, beloved girlfriend looking sulky and drunk at a bar.

When I told Ritsu, "I'm planning her birthday celebration, so could you help me cover it up nicely?", she replied, "Got it," so I reckon it'll probably be fine.

　I must properly apologise to Yui later.

Walking alone through the town as autumn arrives and the air grows gradually chilly, a familiar design suddenly catches my eye. Mesmerised by the shop window, I stop in my tracks.

A four-leaf clover. It's the same design as the earrings Yui gave me on my twentieth birthday.

　I looked up at the shop. So, there was a shop here after all.
Four springs ago, had Yui-san perhaps come here to buy my earrings?

As if drawn in, I passed the guard at the entrance and stepped inside the shop.

I knew these earrings Yui-san gave me were expensive.
But I hadn't known just how much they cost.

　Seeing the price tag on the pair displayed in the showcase, the very same ones adorning my ears, I gasped involuntarily.
I knew Yui-san was the type who didn't spare a penny, but I hadn't realised they were this expensive.
Ah, I see. That explains why the perceptive Seno-san noticed my boyfriend was wealthy.

And yet, back then, Yui-san was still just a university student...

　As I thought this, I spun around to survey the shop. That’s when I noticed a necklace featuring the same motif as my earrings.
The design was identical, but the colour differed. A black clover edged in gold. I pictured it resting upon Yui-san’s chest.

It would suit her perfectly, I thought. My feet moved naturally towards that display case, and I peered inside. The more I looked, the more I felt drawn in, unable to tear my gaze away.

"...Would you like to try it on?"

Perhaps because I'd been staring intently, the shop assistant suddenly spoke to me from behind, making me turn around in a fluster. After saying this with a warm smile, the assistant's gaze shifted to my ears.

"You have mother-of-pearl earrings, don't you? In that case, the matching necklace is over here. I think it would look even more lovely if you coordinated the colour with your earrings."

The shop assistant seemed to be trying to guide me to where the matching necklace was displayed, but I hastily shook my head.

"Ah... um, this isn't for me..."

At that, she stopped dead in her tracks and looked me straight in the eye.

"Well... for my partner."

I wasn't entirely without trepidation about how she might react to me saying "a gift for my partner" about what was clearly women's jewellery... but it was the truth. It wasn't something to be ashamed of, so I tentatively said it anyway.

Then, for a moment, the shop assistant's eyes widened, before she calmly replied, "I see. That's lovely." Somehow, just a little bit of the tension left my shoulders.

"In that case, please do take a closer look."

I took it out of the display case and stared intently at the necklace laid out before me. The stone, said to be onyx, was an endless, deep black. Just like Yui-san's eyes.

The more I looked, the more certain I became that this was the only one.

I glanced at the price tag. Hmm, it's fine. If I spent my entire summer bonus, it wasn't beyond my means.
The image of Yui's face when I gave her this necklace flashed before me, and my cheeks relaxed without me realising. She'd definitely be delighted. After all, it matched my earrings.

"...I'll take this one."

When I said that, the shop assistant smiled warmly and offered to gift-wrap it for me. I nodded.

　Paper bag in hand, I walked to the station in high spirits. All that remained was to arrange the perfect situation to give her this present.

Back in my student days, Yukiyasu-san had arranged a hot spring trip for us, but this year — how about glamping? Summer's over now, so it's just the right season.

That said, I can't drive, so I'll end up asking Yui-san to drive us there after all...

Since we're making the effort, let's hire a rather nice cottage where we can forget all about work and just enjoy ourselves... Splash out and stay somewhere decent. Some places even have hot springs, you can do barbecues, and we could spend the whole day relaxing in nature.

Once the present was decided, one idea after another popped into my head. I'd suggest it to Yui-san first thing on Monday. With that thought, I set off for home.

＊＊＊

Monday morning. Arriving at the office, Yui-san was propped up on her desk, her face clearly sulking.
It was the polar opposite of my own elated mood, now that the birthday celebration plans were set.
Apparently, not being able to go away for two weekends in a row had really rubbed her up the wrong way. Her dark eyes glared at me, full of resentment.

"...So, over the weekend, while you left your girlfriend high and dry, who was Kanata with, and what were you two up to, I wonder..."

Her face practically screamed 'I'm in a foul mood'. I couldn't help but chuckle as I placed my bag on my desk.
Ritsu-san had mentioned she was sulking, but honestly, I hadn't expected it to be quite this intense.
　Lately, we'd only seen each other at work, and I'd missed spending private time together... but knowing she felt the same way made me happy. Yui-san really is adorable.

"Don't sulk like that. I had things to do."

"Hmm...?"

"Besides, didn't you go out drinking with Ritsu-san too?"

"I had no choice but to drink with Ritsu because Kanata wouldn't come stay over."

No choice, huh. And yet it was Yui-san who called Ritsu-san out. Their usual closeness is rather endearing.

"I'll make it up to you properly. Also, there's something I wanted to discuss with you—"

　I'd bought a magazine at the bookshop featuring autumn glamping, planning to choose a place to stay for my birthday with Yui-san.
Just as I reached into my bag to take out the magazine, I was suddenly hugged tightly from behind, startling me and making my hand freeze.

She should have been sitting at her desk just now. When did she get here?

"...Hey, when are you going to make it up to me? Tonight?"

Judging by the tone of Yui-san's voice at my ear, she still seems to be sulking. She's rubbing her head against my neck, which tickles a bit and makes me laugh.

"Tonight... it's Monday, isn't it?"

"But I've been put off for two whole weeks already, haven't I? I can't wait until the weekend."

　Can't wait, she says. What exactly does that mean? I almost ask, but bite my lip hard. Better not ask that, absolutely.

Right now, soothing Yui-san comes first. Thinking that, I turn around, only to have her suddenly pull me close by the waist, closing the distance instantly.
Thinking she's about to kiss me, I hurriedly stop her lips with my palm.

"...Kanata, your hand. It's in the way."

Yui-san frowned, her perfectly shaped brows knitting together in displeasure as she protested. But no. Talking came before kissing right now.
After all, she had an appointment in an hour, and her schedule was packed solid for the entire day. I only had about an hour to talk properly.

"...It's nearly Yui-san's birthday, isn't it?"

"Yeah, that's right."

Even as she said that, her mischievous left hand lifted my skirt and stroked my thigh, making my body jump involuntarily.

"Yui-san! Are you even listening to me!? This is the office, you know...!?"

I scolded her, but Yui-san just narrowed her eyes, her hand moving steadily higher.

"If tonight's no good, then now is fine. No?"

"Of course it's no good!"

My heart pounded as if it might burst, completely ignored by Yui-san who kept pushing forward relentlessly.
Her fingertips finally reached my waist. Startled, I looked at Yui-san. The moment I met her eyes, I realised – oh, she's serious. If she pushes through like this, it'll be trouble.

"What if someone comes in...!?"

"As long as you stifle your voice, Kanata, it'll be fine."

I wanted to retort that she'd said before she wanted to keep work and private life separate, yet what she said and what she did were completely different.
Impossible, absolutely impossible. It might be fine for Yui-san since she's the one doing it, but if I were to be done like that now, I'd be useless for the rest of the day.

"Hey, Yui-san... I'll make it up to you loads on your birthday, won't that do? If you just hold back now, I'll do anything you say on your birthday...!"

Desperately trying to placate her, I blurted out those words, and her hand stopped dead.

"Really?"

Nodding vigorously, her dark eyes fixed on me intently, then she smiled brightly.
Her hand slipped out from beneath my skirt, which she'd pulled up smoothly, and I breathed a sigh of relief.

"All right. In that case... I'll hold off for now."

　Somehow, I felt like I'd made a terribly rash promise just to get through the moment. Would it be alright? I felt a little uneasy.
But... knowing the immediate crisis had passed, I took the magazine I'd bought out of my bag to achieve my goal.

"Yui-san, so, it's your birthday... I was wondering if glamping might be nice?"

"Glamping?"

Yui-san's eyes widened as she looked down at the magazine I was holding.

"It would mean asking you to drive, but I thought we could relax together. What do you say...?"

When I finished, Yui smiled happily, gave a soft chuckle, and pulled me close.

"...Thank you, Kanata. I'm really happy. It's alright, leave the driving to me."

I'd missed staying at Yui's place these past two weeks just as much as she had.
　But because I made her wait so long, I was able to choose a wonderful present. I'll make sure her birthday is a day she'll never forget.

My beloved, beloved girlfriend, who seemed to have finally cheered up, gently stroked my cheek and brought her lips closer.
As I accepted the kiss, I wrapped my arms tightly around her neck and hugged her back, holding her close, so very close.
