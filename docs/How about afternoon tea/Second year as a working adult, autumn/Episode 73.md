Episode 73: Cheating is Not Good

On a Friday evening, the autumn breeze felt pleasantly cool. Staff from the head office had gathered at the company's own hotel in Tokyo, renowned for its beer garden.

"Right then, let's raise a toast to the tremendous success of our new branch!"

The sound of glasses clinking echoed as the Sales Division Director led the toast.

"Right then, Aosawa-chan, cheers!"

She gently clinked her glass against the beer mug Mitsuya-san cheerfully offered. Watching Mitsuya-san gulp down her beer, she also clinked her lemon sour glass against the mug Seno-san had kindly offered with a "Cheers".

　Today was the day for the drinks party celebrating the new branch's great success. Participation was voluntary, and with the company covering all expenses, quite a number of people had turned up; the attendance rate seemed rather high.

My department is currently attached to the president's office, but today I'd sneaked over to my old stomping ground, the Budget Management Section.

　Yui-san seemed intent on going round each table to thank the staff. "If you stay with me, you won't get any time to eat," she said, sending me off with, "Go and eat with the Budget Management Department ladies." Gratefully, I took her up on the offer.

Mitsuya-san flipped thick slices of meat sizzling on the grill with tongs.

　It was a shame Manager Yamazato couldn't join us today as she had to pick up her child.

Placing sliced onions onto the grill with heavy metal chopsticks, I glanced at the two of them.

"Mitsuya-san, Seno-san. I've been meaning to apologise for ages. I'm terribly sorry that my departure meant you both had to work overtime. So, no successor has been decided yet?"

I'd noticed the increase in their overtime since I left, having checked the departmental accounting data.\
It wasn't just once or twice I'd seen Seno-san, whose motto was surely 'leaving on time without fail', still at her desk past six.

　Even if Manager Yamazato is a superwoman at her job, she's on reduced hours, and there's a limit to how much she can handle.

I'd imagined the burden would fall on the two of them, but I hadn't anticipated at all that a replacement still wouldn't be decided.

As she took a sip from her beer mug, Seno-san's eyes widened in surprise.

"Why are you apologising, Aosawa-san? It's not your fault I'm working overtime, is it?"

I hadn't expected her to say that, and I couldn't help letting out a startled "Eh?"

Then Mitsuya-san, biting into a yakitori skewer, fixed her gaze on me.

"It's not your fault, Aosawa-chan. We're working overtime because Seno-san is slow at her job, after all."

　Her words were like arrows, piercingly sharp, and I found myself at a loss for words, offering only a wry smile. Seno-san then pouted her lips in displeasure.

"That's not the way to put it, is it? Unlike you, I'm thorough."

Hearing that, I recalled Seno-san's work habits. Indeed, her desk was always immaculately organised, her work meticulous, and I'd never once heard of a mistake in her paperwork.

　I'd thought she and Mitsuya-san clashed, but perhaps it was simply a difference in their approach to work causing friction.

After teasing Mitsuya-san, Seno-san turned back to me.

"Manager Yamazato seems to be carefully vetting the successor, so I don't think you need to worry. She's quite keen on training people, so I imagine she wants to choose a subordinate she can nurture."

It was true, Manager Yamazato was a skilled mentor, I recalled.\
　Mitsuya-san, who transferred over with me, was already a capable worker back at the previous company.\
Manager Yamazato saw that in an instant after working with her just a little, and after minimal training, assigned her tasks appropriately as an immediate asset.

Someone who can adapt their training approach to suit their subordinates. That's the image I admired in Manager Yamazato.

"But more importantly—"

After setting her mug down with a clunk, Seno-san suddenly leaned in close to me, making me flinch in surprise.

She grinned, narrowing her eyes, then fixed her gaze intently on my chest.

"Aosawa-san, have you finally got a boyfriend?"

"Eh!?"

Mitsuya-san, sitting next to us, let out a startled cry. Realising her gaze was fixed on the necklace at my neckline, I instinctively looked away.

"What what, Aosawa-chan, you finally got a boyfriend? Why didn't you tell us!?"

"Er, um, hold on a moment. I never said I had a boyfriend..."

"I mean, who else but a boyfriend would give you such an expensive necklace as a present when it's not even your birthday?"

Her full lips curved into a smile. Ugh, I was at a loss for words. Surely she hadn't realised this was Yui-san's necklace, but Seno-san really was sharp.

Just like when she noticed the earrings, she seemed to instantly see through things – whether they were gifts and how expensive they were.

"No, this... well..."

I could say it was a gift from my boyfriend, but the problem was whether I could cover it up without giving myself away.

I didn't want to cause trouble for Yui-san, so this relationship absolutely couldn't be mentioned to anyone at work.

"Aosawa-chan, you really were born under a star that attracts wealthy people, weren't you?"

　Saying that, Mitsuya-san cut a thick slice of cooked meat and placed it on my plate.

What does it mean to be born under a star favoured by the wealthy? As I tilted my head in confusion, Seno-san asked Mitsuya-san, "Are there other wealthy people who fancy Aosawa-san?"

Honestly, apart from Yui-san, I don't know any wealthy people, and I can't think of anyone. Wondering who she could be referring to, Mitsuya-san narrowed her slanted eyes further and said,

"Ever since you were at your last company, Aosawa-chan, you were always being courted by Niiyama-san."

Niiyama-san?

I recalled the male employee, three years my senior, whose hair was slicked back with so much wax it reflected the lights. I disliked him and had no interest in him, so I hadn't known. So Niiyama-san was wealthy.

"Niiyama-san, from the production department? He was rich?"

Seno-san said this with apparent interest, and Mitsuya-san gave a slight twitch, raising one perfectly groomed eyebrow.

"Ah... I hear he's a landowner's son. What, are you interested? If so, why not approach him? Aosawa-chan doesn't seem inclined to entertain Niiyama-san's advances, and you'd make a rather suitable pair."

"...What's with that tone? Making me sound like I have no principles."

"But you do like rich people, don't you?"

Mitsuya-san said this looking rather displeased, emptying her beer mug, which made me feel a little uneasy. I'd never heard Mitsuya-san talk about love before, and there was something odd about her attitude now.

—Could it be... Mitsuya-san likes Niiyama-san...?

Mitsuya-san's dismissive remark seemed to momentarily wound Seno-san. Sensing the atmosphere turning sour, I swallowed my meat as best I could and opened my mouth to mediate between them.

It was at that very moment.

"Well, speak of the devil."

I followed the direction Mitsuya-san pointed with his chopsticks.

"Aosawa-san, Mitsuya-san, and Seno-san, good evening."

Standing there, beer mug in hand, was Niiyama-san, wearing his characteristic smile that seemed to lift one side of his cheek.

"Ah, good evening..."

"Mind if I sit here?"

Before I could say yes or no, Niiyama-san pulled out the chair next to me and sat down.\
I couldn't help but give a wry smile at his timing.\
After all, just now, Mitsuya-san and Seno-san had been on the verge of arguing over Niiyama-san.

"Right then, cheers."

I clinked my glass against the mug he offered and gave a slight bow.

"I've been rather busy lately, Aosawa-san, so it's been a shame we haven't had much chance to talk. You're always with the president, after all."

"Well, that's only natural for the president's secretary, isn't it?"

When Mitsuya-san said that, Niiyama-san laughed. I was sure Niiyama-san was a year senior to Mitsuya-san, but she wasn't using honorifics. Come to think of it, these two might have been close for a long time.\
　But — Mitsuya, silently stuffing her face with meat, just didn't look like she fancied Niiyama-san at all...

"Aosawa-san's amazing, isn't he? I was really surprised. Heard there were loads of applicants for the president's secretary position."

It wasn't so much that she'd earned it through merit as that she'd bluffed her way into the seat, but I couldn't say that, so I just laughed it off.

"Thank you."

Just as I was thinking to brush it off and change the subject, Mitsuya-san sighed and turned back to Niiyama-san.

"Niiyama-kun, you really ought to stop pestering Aosawa-chan. It's making her uncomfortable."

After saying this, as if shielding me, Mitsuya-san shot a glare at Seno-san.

"...If you're going to flirt, why not try Seno-san? You'd make a good match."

"Eh?"

The moment the criticism ricocheted, Seno-san, unusually, visibly furrowed his brow.

"Hold on, Kaori—"

"...I'm going for a smoke."

Saying that, Mitsuya-san stood up. Wait a moment, please, Mitsuya-san. Don't leave me behind in this atmosphere—\
Unnoticing my pleading gaze, she stuffed the cigarette packet she'd left on the table into her pocket and walked away.

"Hey, wait up!"

With a clatter, Seno-san too went after Mitsuya-san's retreating back.\
Wait, don't leave me behind too, Seno-san. If Yui-san were to see me alone with Niiyama-san...

"What's she angry about?"

Just as Niiyama-san tilted his head, a hand landed on my shoulder. Startled, I spun round.\
　Looking up, Yui-san was standing right beside me.

"Th-The President...!?"

I thought my breath might stop. Yui-san peered at my face with a bright smile — but her eyes weren't smiling at all.

"Good work today, Niiyama-san."

"Good work today, President."

"What an unusual pairing. Why are you sitting at this table, Niiyama-san?"

Yui-san asked this with a smooth smile, and her words stung my ears. I don't think she's angry about us being at the same table... I think she's asking without any ill intent, but my awareness fixates on the warmth of that hand still resting on my shoulder.

"I just fancied catching up with Aosawa-san after so long. We were quite close back at the old company, chatting often. Right?"

Asked for agreement, I gave a wry smile. No, even if we did talk, it was just small talk. We weren't actually close.\
What should I do? Please, don't say anything else that might fuel Yui-san's jealousy.

　Because the other night — it was awful. Yui-san is usually so incredibly kind, but when that switch flips, she becomes like a different person, so mean.\
If I kept being held like that, I felt like some strange door inside me I didn't even know existed would be forced open. It was terrifying. Just remembering it makes my face flush.

　I know all that jealousy stems from love, but Yui in that mode is a bit... too intense for someone as inexperienced as me.

Yui slid her palm over my shoulder as I stood there, troubled and offering only a wry smile, and opened her mouth.

"Hmm, I see. But didn't you say you had a girlfriend, Aosawa-san? Cheating isn't good, you know."

"Eh!?"

I couldn't help but turn to look at Yui, thinking, Blimey, Yui, what are you saying?

"Really!? Aosawa-san had a girlfriend?"

As Niiyama-san pressed me with his questions, I just... well, I thought, whatever happens, happens, and nodded with a wry smile.

"A-actually... yes, I did get a girlfriend recently."

At that, Niiyama-san slumped, his shoulders dropping dramatically. Seeing him like that, Yui-san beamed, looking thoroughly satisfied.

　After Niiyama-san staggered away from the table, a little while later, Mitsuya-san and Seno-san returned. Neither of them made eye contact at all, making me wonder if they'd had a row. But then again, these two always make up quickly...\
Probably best not to dwell on it. As they say, 'couples' quarrels are of no interest to anyone'.

　Yui-san had moved on to the next table, and just as it seemed the gathering was drawing to a close, my phone buzzed.

　It was a message from Yui-san, and I couldn't help but smile.

——I'll give you a lift home, so let's meet at the station after we finish.

I usually stay at Yui-san's place on Friday nights, but I'd told her I was going back to my own flat tonight because I'd arranged to meet Yuri tomorrow.

It's only a few stops to my place, but Yui-san really is kind.

——I'll wait at the station.

After replying, I downed the last of my lemon sour in one gulp and tucked my phone into my pocket.

With the sales director's interminably long closing speech playing in the background, I watched my girlfriend from a distance, the most beautiful and radiant person in the room.

I just wanted to be alone with her soon... Honestly, that's all I could think about.
