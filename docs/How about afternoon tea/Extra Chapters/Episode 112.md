I brought her along as promised. My girlfriend.

"Hey, Kanata. Which one do you think is better?"

Having finished getting ready for bed, I lay on the bedroom bed, dangling my legs, when Yui-san suddenly held out a navy and a light grey suit right in front of my eyes.

　Judging by her worried expression, it seemed she was agonising over what to wear when meeting my parents.

"You really don't need to wear a suit. It'll take half a day just travelling, so I think you should wear something comfortable?"

"That won't do. I'm going to meet your parents, Kanata, so I have to look proper."

Seeing her, who was always so poised and collected, look so serious made me laugh.

　Having returned from our trip, we were beginning preparations to take our relationship a step further.

First, Yui-san had suggested meeting my parents, so we were coordinating our schedules to head to London.

　Yui-san, though, seems unusually nervous. No matter what she wears, her great figure always makes her look sharp, so she really needn't worry.

I glance at the clock. It's the time we'd normally both be tucked up in bed together.

I wish she'd hurry over here.

Yui-san seems completely unaware that I'm staring at her, thinking just that.

"Hey, Yui. Tomorrow would be fine, wouldn't it? It's late already. Shall we turn in?"

The king-size bed I'd pestered her into buying was chosen specifically with the two of us in mind. It's far too spacious for just one person.

Realising the slight pout in my voice, Yui glanced my way.

"It's important, so you should take choosing it seriously too, Kanata."

　It tickled me inside, knowing she'd normally never give a thought to which suit to wear.

But right now, there was something I wanted her to prioritise over that.

Reluctantly, I got up from the bed and approached Yui, who was staring intently at her suit. I wrapped my arms tightly around her from behind.

The softness and warmth transmitted through her thin nightclothes felt wonderful. It felt like it could blow away a week's worth of fatigue.

　The long-awaited weekend night.

I thought Yui-san felt the same way, but she’d left me alone, staring at the wardrobe the whole time, and I wasn’t amused.

No. When we’re in this room, you have to look only at me.\
I think I understand now, just a little, why Yui-san grumbled about not wanting Shachi-kun in this room.

"Hey, Yui-san... Is that more important than sleeping with me right now?"

I tried to express my slight sulkiness.

"Eh?"

Yui-san let out a surprised gasp, clearly not expecting me to say such a thing.\
She turned to look at me. But I kept my face down so she couldn't see, hugging her body even tighter.

"Yui... Hey, hurry up."

I whispered, pouring every ounce of sweetness into my voice.

It was a little embarrassing, but — I hoped she'd notice how I felt.

As I looked up at her thinking that, there was a thud as the suit she'd been holding fell to the floor, and at the same moment, she pulled me tightly against her waist.

　Her gaze was far more earnest than when she'd been choosing the suit, and I felt a warmth spreading deep within my chest.

Thank goodness, it seems you understood how I felt.\
Your warm arms held me so tightly my body creaked.\
As I surrendered myself to you, your lips gently pressed against mine.

＊＊＊

We, being of the same sex, still cannot marry.

Even so, wanting some tangible proof, we decided to utilise the civil partnership system until that day comes.

　We both agreed we wanted a private wedding, attended only by those who knew and supported our relationship. To make that wish come true, we first wanted to meet my parents — but...

Truth be told, I hadn't yet told my father that the person I was seeing was Yui. Partly because I wanted to surprise him, I'd only said I'd be bringing someone I was seeing.

　As for my father and mother, they'd be fine, but what would their reaction be to seeing Yui? Just imagining it was rather amusing.\
Yui seemed completely focused on how my parents would react, but I hadn't yet told her that my younger brother, Kaname, was actually the tougher nut to crack.\
Thinking about how the usually composed Yui would react to Kaname was thrilling, and knowing that, no matter what, Kaname would accept her, this was just a little mischievous thought.

　I gaze at the ring glinting on my ring finger.\
Like this, bit by bit, our relationship solidifies.

When I return to Japan, I want to give Yui a ring too.\
When I told her I wanted us to go buy engagement rings together, she said she wanted a wedding ring instead of an engagement ring, so I just smiled and nodded.

　Departure day.\
After agonising over it, she ended up in a navy suit, pulling her suitcase with a tense expression.\
It takes half a day from Haneda to London – if she's this nervous now, won't she be exhausted? I thought, giving her clasped hand a gentle tug.

"Hey, Yui-san, there's no need to be so nervous. My father has met you before, after all."

"Eh? I've met Kanata's father?"

Yui looked at me in surprise, and I gave her a faint smile.

"He said he met you when you were little. It's not like you're meeting for the first time, so it'll be fine."

"Oh, is that so?"

I didn't tell her it was at her mother's funeral. Yui was only in first grade back then, so it was no wonder she didn't remember.

"I wonder how my father will react. He'll probably recognise you the moment he sees your face. It'll be interesting. Maybe he'll freeze in shock."

"I hope shock is all it is. ...Just between us, though, my father gave me quite a hard time. When I told him I was going to meet Kanata's parents, he said, 'I never imagined my own daughter would get involved with my best friend's daughter. What on earth am I supposed to say when I meet Aosawa?'"

I chuckled, picturing Yui-san's father, who was probably holding his head in his hands. After all, even the idea of Yui-san and I sharing a flat had originally come from her father.

Through countless connections, we now walk side by side.\
　As irreplaceable partners sharing our lives, I can't imagine anything happier than having our dearest people bless us as we embark on this journey together.

I steal a glance at her profile.\
Seeing Yui, who'd always been so poised and unflappable in any major meeting or deal crucial to the company's future, looking far more nervous than usual, warmed my heart.

Flying business class was truly comfortable and peaceful for me, but it seems it wasn't the same for Yui-san.\
That's why I told her to wear something less tiring, yet as soon as we arrived, she stretched her stiffened body and sighed.

"Yui-san, are you alright?"

"Yes, I'm fine. ...Just a bit tense."

I smiled at her as she let out a sigh through her shoulders, then took her hand and led her along the familiar airport path.

Kaname had come to meet us at the airport in his car.

Spotting Kaname waiting for us in the arrivals hall, I waved. After glancing at me once, his gaze immediately slid over to Yui beside me.

　He narrowed his eyes, the same light brown as mine, and stared at Yui-san appraisingly.

Yui-san seemed to sense Yo's sharp gaze instantly. She glanced at his profile and swallowed slightly.

"Kaname, it's been a while. Thanks for coming to pick us up."

"Pleased to meet you, I'm Ichinose Yui."

"...Pleased to meet you, Aosawa Kaname."

An awkward silence hung between Kaname, who looked like he wanted to say something, and Yui, who smiled shyly at him.\
Ignoring it, I laughed and squeezed her hand tightly.

"Yui's the one who let me share her place during uni, you know. See, Kaname? Just like I said, Yui's absolutely gorgeous, isn't she?"

"Huh, university...? I see, so that's how it was. Well, no wonder she made my sister cry. She looks like she'd be incredibly popular."

"Eh?"

After narrowing his eyes and delivering that one stinging remark to Yui, Kaname's gaze slid down to my ring finger before he gave a faint smile.

"Ah well. If my sister's happy now... If you've gone to the trouble of coming all this way, I suppose it means you won't be making my sister cry anymore, right? Come on, let's go. Dad and Mum are waiting."

He said it so casually, twirling the car key between his index finger and thumb, then abruptly turned his back and started walking.

"Making her cry..." Could it be that Kaname realised Yui-san was the reason I came back to London midway through my university days?

"...Kanata. Do you think Kaname hates me?"

Yui murmured in a voice too soft for Kaname to hear, her expression slightly hurt.

"Kaname's just a big sister's boy. But he's an honest lad... Don't worry, he'll understand."

"I hope so..."

Yui said, wiping the sweat beading on her forehead. I couldn't help but smile at her expression.

　But, Yui-san might not realise it, but this was probably Yo making a concession.\
I'm sure he had a mountain of things he wanted to say, but he swallowed them all and offered his congratulations. I resolved to thank him for that someday, absolutely.

　When I went to sit in the passenger seat, Kaname said we could both sit in the back. So, leaning back in the car seat, I gazed at the London streets through the window and told Yui about my memories of living here.

Normally, I'd be succumbing to jet lag and falling asleep on this journey, but today, being with Yui, I wasn't sleepy at all.

　The other day, Father mentioned that his long posting to Britain was drawing to a close and he expected to return to Japan soon.\
So, before that happens, I'm truly glad I could bring Yui-san to this city.

When I got out of the car and opened the front door, Father stood there, tie neatly knotted, looking tense. I almost burst out laughing.

"Dad, Mum, I'm home!"

"Oh... welcome home, Kanata."

You could tell he was tense at a glance. And the moment Yui-san stepped out from behind me — Dad's eyes widened in shock.

"Eh... ? Eh... ?"

He stared blankly at Yui-san's face, and I could barely hold back my laughter.

"Father, thank you for always looking after us. I'm Yui Ichinose."

Father continued to stare at Yui, who introduced herself in a clear, resonant voice, his expression still one of utter astonishment.\
I couldn't hold back any longer. I laughed, grabbed Yui's arm, and pulled her close, hugging her tightly.

"Father, I brought her, just as promised. My girlfriend."

"Eh... Eh?!"

　＊＊＊

"Blimey, that gave me a fright. Thought my heart would stop... Never imagined your girlfriend would be Yui-chan... Why didn't you two tell me, Kanata and Fuyuto?"

"We wanted to surprise you, Dad."

I laughed at my father, who slumped into the sofa with a sigh.

　Mum was beaming happily as she prepared tea, and just as I'd hoped, the atmosphere was so warm that Yui-san seemed to relax her tension and smiled too.

"I knew the moment I saw your face. Yui-chan, you really do take after your mother in beauty. Your hair colour and eyes are more like Fuyuto's, but your features are just like your mother's."

Dad pulled a notebook from the shelf and handed Yui-san a photo tucked inside.\
　It was the very photo I'd seen years ago, the one of Yui-san's parents when they were university students.

"Look, a photo from their university days. They both look so fresh-faced, don't they?"

Yui-san stared intently at the image of the two smiling and leaning close together. Then, tracing their figures gently with her fingertips, she smiled happily.

"Ever since I was a child, talking about Mum was like a taboo... I never really heard much from Dad about what kind of person she was either. So I haven't seen many photos... But they look happy, Dad... and Mum too."

I took Yui-san's hand, murmuring as she spoke, squeezing it tightly without a thought for being in front of her parents.

"...I'm glad you both look happy, Kanata and Yui-chan. Thank you for coming all this way to see us."

As Father spoke, his words seeming to linger, Yui lifted her gaze and looked straight at him with a serious expression.

"...I came here today because I wanted your permission to spend the rest of my life with Kanata. What I can offer Kanata is certainly not much, but even so, I swear I will spend my entire life making Kanata happy. So..."

"You don't need my permission. That's something Yui-chan and Kanata decide for yourselves. No one has the right to deny what you two have decided."

Saying this, my father fixed his gaze firmly on me.

"Kanata. Yui-chan... cherish her, alright?"

"Yes, I know. I'll cherish Yui-san forever and ever."

I nodded firmly too.\
　I feel no anxiety about the life ahead. I see only happiness. As long as we can live together forever.

"Yui-chan. Thank you for loving Kanata. My daughter... I ask you to continue looking after her from now on."

　＊＊＊

　Every time someone acknowledges us, it feels like our bond grows stronger.

　I wanted the same ring.\
　And that dream is finally about to come true.

I want us both to wear wedding dresses and vow to love each other in sickness and in health. That moment will surely become an unforgettable, blissful memory in my life.

Well — I tried to sound all grand and romantic there, but really, I just want to be Yui-san's wife.

The resolve to love just one person for a lifetime.\
I think that's something truly precious.

　When I invited her into my room, Yui looked around as if seeing something utterly novel.\
It was an ordinary, unremarkable room, yet Yui gazed at it with sparkling eyes.

"Please sit on the bed."

"Right, thank you. So this is the room Kanata lived in all this time. Hey, Kanata. Show me some old photos, from when you were a child."

Completely relaxed and utterly sleepy, I'd been planning to quickly unpack and then have a lazy nap with Yui-san, so I was taken aback by this sudden request.

"Photos? I suppose I have some..."

I retrieved an album from the wall-mounted bookshelf and handed it to Yui-san.\
After receiving it, she stroked the album carefully before gently opening the cover.\
I sat down beside her, leaning my shoulder against hers as I peered into the album.

I rarely look back at photos of myself as a child — it felt nostalgic.

"How cute. How old were you here?"

"Hmm... this one... first or second year of primary school, I think?"

It was a photo of me wearing my school satchel and walking hand-in-hand with my father.\
Yui-san smiled, her eyes narrowing affectionately, and my heart gave a little squeeze.

"Hey, Yui-san?"

"Hmm?"

I tugged her sleeve, urging her to look at me. But she seemed completely absorbed in the album and didn't look my way at all.

"...Was I cuter back then?"

I said it sulkily, and Yui-san suddenly looked up from the album.\
She smiled at my sulking and gently pulled me closer by the waist.

"Whether now or back then, Kanata, you're the cutest in the whole world."

"Right then, that's enough of the album."

"Eh? Why? I want to see more. I haven't seen nearly enough yet!"

"No. I'm sleepy now. Let's sleep together."

I clung tightly to her, using my weight to push Yui-san down. The single bed groaned, but I didn't care and snuggled up against her.

"Yui-san, give me a proper hug."

"Right, right, alright. If it's a request from my adorable little princess, I'll grant anything."

Her arms wrapped around my back, pulling me close.

"...But Kanata, if you fall asleep now, won't you be unable to sleep tonight?"

"It'll be fine because I'm with Yui-san. I'll wake up properly and show you around, just as promised. My favourite town where I spent my time."

If we can wake up together with the morning sun tomorrow, let's ride the cramped underground and go buy tea together.

And come afternoon, I plan to treat her to the most splendid afternoon tea.
