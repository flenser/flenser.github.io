I really want to go to Disney Sea! part 2

Passing through the entrance gate, the long-awaited theme park spread out before us. Everyone's favourite, Disney Sea.

How many years had it been? The last time I'd been here was back when my family still lived in Japan, so it must have been since primary school.\
My heart leapt at the distinctly Disney-esque music drifting in from all directions.

Suppressing the urge to dash off, I squeezed Yui-san's hand tightly and pulled her along.

"Hey, Yui, let's go buy a headband first, a headband! I'll pick one out that suits you perfectly."

When you come to Disney, you absolutely must buy an ear-shaped headband.\
I remember when I was brought here as a child, I got a Mickey Mouse headband... and I never took it off, not even when I went to sleep.

"Alright. Shall we head to the shops first then?"

"Mm."

She nodded, and Yui-san smiled softly, her eyes narrowing.\
I really love that smile. Somehow, affection just overflows from her gaze.\
The feeling that she adores me flows warmly from those dark eyes into my heart.

We walked along, swaying our joined hands to the music drifting by.

"When you came to Disney with Ritsu before, what year of university were you in?"

"Ah... fourth year... summer, I think."

Fourth year summer...\
By then, I wasn't by Yui-san's side anymore. Not noticing my stumbling words, Yui-san continued.

"Ritsu suddenly came to my house and said, 'How long are you going to stay in bed? We're going out.' I protested, 'No, I don't want to go,' but she pulled the duvet off me, grabbed my feet, dragged me out of bed... she literally forced me to come along..."

I could easily picture the two of them wrestling and chuckled.\
Ritsu-san is kind to us juniors like me and Yuri, but she really shows Yui-san no mercy.

　It's hard to believe they only met at university – Yui and Ritsu get on so well and have remained such close friends ever since. You'd almost believe they'd known each other since birth.\
There are moments when I think that even for Ritsu, who has so many friends, Yui is somehow a special one.

"I was really down after Kanata left, so I think Ritsu was trying to cheer me up... But it was the height of summer, unbearably hot, and she dragged me around all day without a word of warning. I was completely knackered... Then, watching the parade that night, I said, 'I'm never coming back,' and she doubled over laughing."

Yui laughed, as if recalling the scene.

　We rarely bring up the time we were apart. So hearing this was refreshing.\
It’s more accurate to say we deliberately avoided it.\
We both know without asking that the time apart isn’t a fond memory for either of us.

But hearing things like this occasionally makes me think how truly wonderful it is that Ritsu was there beside Yui. Though I suppose it’s selfish of me to think this, having been the one who left Yui behind.

"...Well then, today I'll turn Yui-san's bad memories of Disney into the best memories of the year, shall I?"

I pounded my chest as I said it, and Yui-san squeezed my hand back tightly.

"Hehe, no need to worry about me. They're already good memories."

"Eh? But we've only just arrived?"

"Seeing Kanata so happy... that alone made coming here worthwhile."

Yui-san smiles happily when she sees me.\
She always says things that make me blush like that.\
She hasn't changed one bit since our university days.\
And I absolutely adore that about her. It makes me feel truly loved, warming my heart deep inside.

　Though perhaps less crowded than weekends, even weekdays see plenty of people at Disney.\
Weaving through the throng into the shop, we passed the souvenir section and headed for the display of headbands.\
Picking up a Mickey Mouse ear headband that seemed most suited to Yui-san, I turned towards her.

"Yui-san, try this on."

I reached out slightly and placed it on her head.\
The two black, round ears blended beautifully with her long, glossy black hair and looked utterly adorable.

"Hehe, Yui-san, you look cute."

"Does it suit me?"

"Yes."

"Which one will you choose, Kanata?"

"I'll get the same one as Yui-san."

　Saying that, I picked up the same headband as Yui-san and tried it on my head. Before checking myself in the mirror, I looked up at Yui-san.

"What do you think? Does it suit me?"

Looking at Yui-san excitedly, she stared down at me intently before suddenly covering her mouth with her hand.

"Eh... Yui-san? Does it not suit me?"

　Asking anxiously, Yui-san shook her head vigorously from side to side.

"No... you look absolutely adorable. Makes me want to hug you. I finally understand why everyone wants a headband now."

Hearing Yui-san say this with sparkling eyes, I couldn't help but feel embarrassed and looked away.

Honestly, you didn't have to say 'adorable' so loudly... I'm happy, but I'm a bit conscious of the stares around us.

"I-I suppose so... Does it suit me?"

"Yes, it suits you perfectly. Let's get this one. I'll go buy it right away."

Yui gently removed my headband, so I blushed and tidied my slightly messy fringe.

＊＊＊

　Wearing a headband at Disney makes me feel like I'm part of this dreamland myself, and it's such fun.

"Right then, we're ready. Shall we go? I'll check the wait times."

As we left the shop and I checked attraction wait times on the app, Yui looked down at me and murmured quietly.

"...When you wear your hair in a ponytail, Kanata, it reminds me of your university days."

"Eh?"

Seeing my hair tied up today, full of enthusiasm for a day of fun, Yui-san smiled nostalgically.

"You always had your hair tied up after work, didn't you, Kanata? I really liked it. That coffee smell, and your ponytail too."

"Do you actually like ponytails, Yui-san?"

"I like you no matter what hairstyle you have. You're always lovely."

"...Yui-san, you've always complimented me on everything, haven't you? Don't you dislike anything about me?"

When someone says they like you so much all the time, it makes you wonder if there really isn't anything they dislike.

I stared intently into her dark eyes, almost suspiciously, and Yui-san smiled back at me.

"No, I love everything about you."

Words of love spoken with effortless grace.\
Even amidst the bustling music and atmosphere, my eyes always seem to focus solely on Yui-san, as if she were the only one in sight.\
No matter how many years we spend together, my heart still flutters for Yui-san. I do hope she feels the same way. Even when we're old ladies.

"...Oh, Yui-san, saying things like that... please save it for when we're alone at home..."

"Sorry, sorry, I'll be careful."

I lowered my head, pouting my lips to hide the flush spreading across my cheeks, and Yui-san smiled softly again.

　Passing through the street lined with shops, a vast sea came into view at the centre.\
This atmosphere, reminiscent of a Mediterranean port town, was quintessentially 'Disney Sea' and utterly charming.\
The water surface sparkled, reflecting the sunlight.

Beyond the sea, a hazy flame rose from distant mountains, making Yui-san flinch and her shoulders tremble.

"W-whoa, that startled me...!"

"Wow, what a promising start! Getting to see an eruption right after arriving."

Feeling light-hearted, I began strolling leisurely.

"Really?"

"It erupts occasionally. There's a roller coaster at the foot of that mountain too, so let's ride it later."

"H-huh... a roller coaster... there are loads of them, aren't there..."

"That's right. Shall we go then! First, straight to our main attraction, the Tower of..."

"Eh!? H-hold on a moment, Kanata!"

My hand, which she was holding, was tugged sharply, making me stop. Startled, I turned to look at Yui-san, who gave me a bright smile.

"Hey, if we go on the thing we were most looking forward to first, won't that leave us with nothing left to look forward to?"

"Eh? No, that won't happen. There are loads of other rides, after all... Oh, right! You mentioned before that you eat taiyaki from the tail end, didn't you? Are you the type who likes to save the best for last?"

"Y-yeah, exactly. Plus, we just had breakfast, didn't we? So... shouldn't we start with something a bit gentler? I mean... I'm not quite mentally or physically ready yet... I want to tackle it in peak condition..."

　Yui scratched her cheek awkwardly and mumbled something indistinctly.

It was unusual for Yui, who always put me first, to voice her own wishes.\
Had she been looking forward to today that much?\
Feeling delighted, I squeezed Yui's hand tightly with both of mine.

"So you were looking forward to that ride too, Yui! Hehe, I'm so happy. Right then, shall we start with the gondola ride? The boarding point is just nearby."

"Y-yeah, let's do that..."

Feeling light-hearted, I took Yui-san's hand again and she followed behind me.

"...If Kanata... is happy... it'll be alright... it'll be alright... I can definitely manage..."

"Hm? Yui-san, did you just say something?"

"No, it's nothing. Nothing at all."

Yui-san shook her head vigorously from side to side.

Truthfully, at that moment, I did think Yui-san seemed a little different than usual... but back then, I couldn't have imagined for a second that there was something she found difficult.
