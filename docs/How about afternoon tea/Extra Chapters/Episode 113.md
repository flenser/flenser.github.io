I really want to go to Disney Sea! part 1

"Listen, Yui. I've got a favour to ask..."

I timed it perfectly, waiting until Yui got home and was washing her hands in the sink, then plucked up the courage to speak to her from behind.\
She looked at me through the mirror, a puzzled expression on her face.

After drying her hands, Yui turned to face me.\
Her long lashes blinked repeatedly, a look of wonder in her eyes.

"What is it? A favour?"

　Truth be told, I was about to ask Yui-san out on another date.\
I knew she'd grant any request I made, yet I always felt nervous at the moment of asking for something.

"Well... there's somewhere I'd like to go with you, Yui-san. Weekends get crowded, so I was wondering if we could take a day off together on a weekday... Would that be alright? Are you busy...?"

　Lately, Yui-san had been working late a lot, often coming home late.\
She'd mentioned just the other day over dinner that things were finally settling down at work, so I plucked up the courage to suggest it.

Was it too selfish a request?\
Feeling uneasy, I glanced up. Yui-san looked down at me with gentle eyes.

"No, it's absolutely fine. Sure, let's take paid leave together. Where do you want to go?"

"That's wonderful...! I'd love to go to Disney Sea!"

"Eh... Disney Sea?"

"Come to think of it, I haven't been since I came back to Japan... And there's no Disneyland in England..."

"Oh, I see... Right, Disney Sea. I think the last time I went was with Ritsu back in university... Haha..."

"I thought Disney Sea might be better since you can have drinks there, but would Disneyland be better?"

I'm so relieved she didn't refuse.\
Overjoyed, I hugged Yui-san tightly and asked. Which would be better, the Land or the Sea?

"No, it's fine. Sea is fine. Um... just to be sure, what kind of fun do you like, Kanata?"

　Yui-san placed her hand on my shoulder and looked at me with a serious gaze.\
What kind of fun? What does that even mean?\
I tilted my head, and Yui-san cleared her throat once.

"Well, for example, wanting to enjoy the shows, or wanting to go on the rides... People have different ways of enjoying themselves, right?"

Ah, that's what she meant.\
　True, time is limited, so we can't do everything. It might be important to agree beforehand on what we prioritise.

Still, I reckon Yui-san would probably prioritise all my wishes anyway.

"Hmm, well... I'd love to go on lots of rides. Especially those... the ones where you drop! Let's go on them together, alright?"

"The ones... where you drop, huh... Oh, that one... Right, I see... The ride... Yeah, that's fine..."

"Hehe, I'm looking forward to it. Hey, Yui-san, when shall we go?"

I get so happy I hug Yui-san tightly.\
Somehow, a theme park date feels so much like something lovers would do, it's really nice!\
I hope I get to go on lots of rides with Yui-san.

"In that case... Friday would be good, I suppose? I've got the next day off."

"Right then, I'll apply for paid leave for Friday!"

"Right, I'll do the same. If it makes Kanata happy, I'll make the effort..."

"Hehe, thank you. Let's have lots of fun, shall we?"

Even though she's busy, she's making the effort to take paid leave for my sake. Yui-san really is so kind.

I'd love to pick out a headband that suits Yui-san.

On weekdays it should be less crowded than weekends, and the queues for attractions probably won't be too bad either.\
Well, knowing Yui-san, I wouldn't be entirely surprised if she'd splash out on premium passes to avoid long queues...

＊＊＊

Whether it was down to the teruteru-bōzu I made on Thursday night is uncertain, but come Friday as promised, it was a clear, sunny day just as I'd hoped.

　As I put on my trainers at the front door and tapped my toes, Yui-san smiled at me.

"Trainers today? That's rather refreshing."

"I bought them especially for today, as I plan to play loads. I've broken them in properly, so I think I'm well prepared."

I declared confidently, chest puffed out, and Yui-san laughed.

　It wasn't just the shoes; I'd deliberately bought comfortable shirts and trousers for today too.\
I usually tend to choose skirts and blouses, but today, anticipating the rides, I'd even tied my hair neatly into a ponytail. My luggage was kept to an absolute minimum, of course.

"Right then, I'll wear my walking-friendly trainers today too."

Yui-san pulled a pair of sporty trainers with what looked like highly cushioned soles from the shoe rack.

　Yui-san is so stylish she has loads of shoes, not just trainers, but I still think trainers suit her best. I reckon the impression she made when we first met plays a big part in that.

Those two-tone trainers, like that killer whale... I wonder if she'll wear them again someday.

"Right, shall we go?"

"Ah, Yui-san, wait!"

I hurriedly tug lightly on Yui-san's arm as she was about to step out the front door.\
　Realising my intention, Yui-san gave me a sly smile and leaned in to touch her lips to mine. A gentle kiss.

"...Oh, come on. You mustn't forget your goodbye kiss."

Puffing out my cheeks in a sulky pout, Yui-san apologised with a smile and kissed me again.

＊＊＊

How many years had it been since I last visited Disney Sea? Hand in hand with Yui, I swayed aboard the train decorated with mouse characters.

I love this train. It makes me feel truly excited, as if it might actually take me to a dreamland.

"It's amazing how everything can be done through the app these days, isn't it?"

"Yeah, right? Being able to check maps and wait times is brilliant."

"When you came with Ritsu, did you go to Land or Sea?"

"I went to Land with Ritsu... Hmm, it wasn't exactly a great memory... It was a bit of a disaster."

Yui-san said it with such a disheartened tone that I tilted my head.

"A disaster?"

When I asked back, Yui-san looked up as if startled and shook her head frantically from side to side.

"Ah, no... well, you know, Ritsu's got that personality, so she dragged me around non-stop from opening to closing without a break... it was exhausting."

"Ahaha, that sounds just like Ritsu-san."

I could picture it.\
With that lively energy, she'd probably be as fit as a fiddle after running around from morning till night.\
I've never met anyone with more stamina than Ritsu-san.

"Ah, right! Didn't you go when Ritsu-san was in Osaka? That theme park?"

"Didn't go. I was invited, but I said no way."

I laughed at Yui-san, who was shaking her head vigorously from side to side.

"Well then... next time, shall we invite Yuri and Ritsu-san and all go to Disneyland together?"

"Eh? No way. If I went with Ritsu, I'd die. I could manage it with Kanata, but with Ritsu? Absolutely not."

It's not even the sort of place you need to 'manage', Yui-san, you're so strange. But it really made me happy that she'd go anywhere with me.

While we were talking like that, the train had arrived at our destination.

I was feeling incredibly giddy at that moment... I never imagined for a second that something like that would happen afterwards.
