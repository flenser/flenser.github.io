Episode Three: The Final Curtain ―July 2033―

"They agonised over it together, cried, suffered, and finally reached their decision. But you know, they're just normal friends now. I reckon most of the kids haven't even realised they've split up yet."

I hadn't realised myself until Ryōka told me directly.

"As a teacher, I tend to think career paths should take priority over romance... but for young people like Sasaki-san and Fuwa-kun, it must have been an incredibly courageous choice."

The teacher looked troubled, yet seemed impressed by Ryōka's decision.

"I was genuinely surprised, you know. I couldn't imagine a future where Ryōka would let Fuwa go. So I couldn't help asking her, 'Why did you break up?' And she just smiled and said, 'I thought it wasn't good to get too caught up in romance at this stage. It was a decision made thinking about the future ahead – a positive breakup!' Somehow, without me realising, my best friend had grown up."

　I never believed that cliché about growing up through heartbreak – it sounded cheap and fake. But seeing Ryōka's change firsthand, I couldn't completely dismiss it anymore.

"...Could you ask Sasaki-san to join the study sessions again? Once she decides on her target university, I can guide her through past papers. Our school tends to offer less intensive exam preparation for regional universities compared to those in the city centre. I genuinely want to support her as much as I can."

"I'll pass it on. Thanks, Sensei."

I thanked her on my friend's behalf. True to her word, Sensei would strive wholeheartedly to support Ryoka. She really is a wonderful 'Sensei'.

　Yes, Sensei is, a 'teacher'.

After telling myself that, I took a breath.

"I realised something. Ryōka, Fuwa, and... even you, Sensei, are all acting with the future in mind. But I'm only thinking about the romance right in front of me... I can't stop thinking about you. I'm the only one being selfish, only thinking about myself... No wonder you can't accept my feelings like this."

"...There's nothing wrong with you, Uehara-san."

The teacher was as kind as ever. Even if it stemmed from her role as a teacher, I was glad, and I loved that about her too.

"Sensei."

So, I understood and accepted her position, her thoughts, her wishes.

Looking into those beautiful eyes fixed on me, I declared.

"You didn't accept my feelings because you were thinking about my future, weren't you? ...I finally understand."

At that moment, the teacher's eyes widened for an instant... then, the corners of her mouth relaxed slightly.

"Then, do you also understand what I most wanted to convey?"

"Yes. What I should be doing now isn't pursuing you, but studying for my entrance exams. I want to make the most of the university opportunity you've given me. So... from now on, to focus on my exams, I think I'll keep my distance from you."

I tried to speak casually, so as not to cause you any unnecessary worry.

Because even though I don't regret my decision, it doesn't change the fact that I'll miss you.

"I think it's a wise decision. I wholeheartedly support your choice, Uehara-san."

"...Thanks. Somehow, that really gave me strength!"

　When I forced a smile and said that, the teacher responded with an incredibly gentle smile.

"Hey, Sensei. That 'Do Whatever I Say' voucher I got for Christmas... can I use it right now?"

"I hadn't anticipated you using it at this moment... but yes, go ahead. Ask for anything you wish."

The teacher, with her understated yet beautiful features, gazed at me with her large eyes.

　――I fought back the flood of emotions threatening to spill from the back of my throat.

Holding back tears until the very end, yet determined to leave an impression on the teacher's memory, I declared with the most resolute expression I could muster.

"Tell me the one thing you most want to say to me right now."

The teacher would surely... no, the teacher I'd come to like would absolutely give me the words I longed to hear.

　She looked straight at me and declared firmly.

"Uehara-san, you'll be fine. You absolutely will get into your first-choice university."

I realised once more that I did like her.

—Though I'd never voice that feeling again.

"Thank you, Sensei. I'm glad I met you."

Any more words would be superfluous. I picked up my bag and started to leave the classroom, finally, at the doorway, I bowed once more towards Sensei before turning away and walking out.

My story with Sensei began in the second elective classroom of the West Building.

And its final curtain, was drawn in this very place.
