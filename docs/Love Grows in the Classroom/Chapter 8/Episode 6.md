Episode Six: Future Value ―December 2033―

If anyone saw me making contact with the teacher now, there'd be no room for explanation.

For one thing, I'd declared I was breaking ties with her to focus solely on exam prep, yet here I was breaking that very vow myself.

I didn't want to be seen as a weak-willed student. But I simply had to, absolutely had to, see the teacher. I needed to look her in the eyes and hear her reasons.

　Because this is just... impossible to accept!

"...She's here..."

Her car is here. Thank goodness I'd heard from my form tutor that after that photo spread, she'd been ordered to stay home.

It would be sad if she played hard to get, but the teacher has always been sincere with me. Convinced she wouldn't do that, I pressed the intercom.

After about ten seconds of silence.

"...I have no intention of letting you in."

Hearing her voice so close again, even through the machine, sent a flutter through my cells.

That my body reacted even in this situation... love really is terrifying.

"Then let's talk outside. I won't move from here until I see your face properly and get a proper explanation!"

For longer than before, she remained silent.

　But after a while... Click. The sound of the lock opening from the inside, and the door opened just a crack.

Seeing the weary expression that must have come after hesitation made me feel inexplicably heartbroken, yet I drew a clear line and bowed my head.

"Come in. Let's get this over with quickly."

I nodded and quietly entered the teacher's house. Led into the room, which was as neatly tidied as ever, I sat down at the dining table.

"I'm sorry for turning up so suddenly. But you must understand why I came to see you, right?"

The teacher sitting opposite me had let down the hair she usually wore tied back in a single ponytail today. Lowering her eyes, she let out a small sigh.

"It was rash. Being alone together now would only fuel the rumours. You should refrain from impulsive actions that could affect your future."

"I spoke to the headmaster today. I'll probably be fine. ...But I'm more worried about your future than mine! Why didn't you deny the rumours?! Were you trying to protect me?!"

"Because your future is far more valuable than mine."

She stated it with such direct, unwavering eyes. The pressure in it had the power to silence my counterarguments.

"...How can you be so... certain?"

"Because you are a high school student. You can become anything from here on. You can choose anything. I couldn't possibly destroy such a child's future."

"But still..."

Within the teacher's calm tone, kindness and a sense of responsibility seeped through. I felt tears welling up somehow and pressed my lips together.
