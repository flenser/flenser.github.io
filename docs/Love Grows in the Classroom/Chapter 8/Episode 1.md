Episode One: Heartbreak ―July 2033―

From realising my feelings for the teacher, confessing my love, and then being utterly and completely rejected.

I’d made the utterly foolish mistake of thinking that if it was between two women, falling in love might bring a sense of security.

　Just touching my teacher made my heart feel like it would burst, I became so distraught I couldn't control my emotions, I lost all capacity to consider her feelings... In the end, I hurt her and caused trouble. Even though she was someone I adored.

I learnt the hard way that romantic feelings make no distinction between gender. ...Though that lesson and its price cost me many things.

　When I was alone in the quiet house, those after-school exchanges with the teacher in the classroom would race vividly through my mind, tormenting me.

Anger towards the teacher for not understanding my feelings, guilt over why I'd let my emotions get the better of me and say such awful things. And... regret over that despicable act of ignoring the teacher's wishes and forcing a kiss on them.

　I hated it all, couldn't forgive myself. At school, I desperately pretended everything was normal, but once I returned home alone like this, days dragged on where I lay motionless as if dead.

...I truly felt grateful that my schedule was out of sync with Mum's.

Because if I'd forced myself to act cheerful even at home, I felt I might break.

　　　　　　　　　　☆

Two weeks had passed since I stopped interacting with the teacher.

　They say the pain of love is healed by finding someone new or by time, but neither offered any reason for my recovery yet.

My exam prep? I wasn't doing it. Even though the teacher had taught me so much, even though the teacher had come to the house and persuaded Mum, right now, even sitting at my desk felt impossible.

...What am I doing? Using a low mood or lack of concentration as excuses not to study? That's just rubbish. I knew full well in my head that the teacher would be utterly dismayed, yet I couldn't control either my body or my mind, no matter how hard I tried.

It wasn't the teacher who pulled me back from the brink of hating myself – it was my best friend, Suzuka.

"I've broken up with Sōma."

　It happened on the train home from school, as we sat side by side.

As if it were no big deal, Suzuka casually dropped the news.

"...Eh? When⁉"

"Hmm, about a week ago?"

Even though I'd been barely holding myself together lately, I saw Suzuka every day at school. Not noticing my best friend's heartbreak was a shock.

"I had absolutely no idea... Wait, Fuwa, she even came to talk to you during lunch break today, didn't she? Did you really break up...? Why...? Why...?"

"Well, you know, I can't just spend all my time on romance."

As I faltered at her matter-of-fact answer, Ryōka continued with a face that seemed to have cast off everything, radiant.

"I agonised over it, but I realised I still want to go to university in Hokkaido. So I talked it over with Sōma-kun, who wants to go to university in Tokyo, loads of times. Neither of us are the type who could handle a long-distance relationship. ...But we just couldn't see eye to eye, no matter how much we talked. So we broke up. You know, prioritising our studies and all that!"

"But... but, Ryōka... are you really okay with that? You don't regret it...?"

Was this truly a parting she accepted wholeheartedly? Had she really come to terms with her feelings? If she was suffering through each day with regret or loneliness, I couldn't just leave her be.

"Yeah, I'm fine! I decided this after properly thinking it through – I don't think it's good to get too wrapped up in romance at this stage! It's the result of considering my future. A positive breakup!"

She said it in a bright voice, flashing a refreshing smile.

I'd always assumed Ryoka, who tended to base her decisions on her boyfriend Fuwa, was the type to prioritise romance above all else.

But of course, Ryoka was just like me and our classmates – a third-year high school student standing at a crossroads in life. She must have agonised over many things, thought deeply, overcome her conflicts and doubts, and made that one crucial choice.

Thinking that, my eyes suddenly stung.

Ryōka had definitely changed. While I was wallowing in my heartbreak, she had grown through hers.

"...Ryōka, you're amazing. I'm just useless... I could only think of myself. I just ran wild, wanting special treatment from the teacher. Even though she was always thinking about my future... I ruined everything. I trampled all over her feelings..."

Compared to the teacher and Ryōka, I felt ashamed of my own immaturity.

"What's wrong, Meisa? Did something happen?"

I couldn't hold back any longer at Ryōka's concern. I wanted her to hear about that exchange in the classroom after school – the one I'd decided to keep to myself until I could process it properly.

"Well, actually, it's about the teacher and—"

Ryoka, who'd been nodding along as I spoke, looked serious when I finished.

"But you know, isn't it understandable that you're a bit self-centred when you're in love? I mean, you're still a baby, Meisa."

"...Wh-what do you mean?"

She didn't seem to be joking, but I didn't understand why she was treating me like a baby. When I asked her plainly, Ryōka puffed out her chest proudly.

"Meisa, who's fallen for someone for the first time, is confused by these new feelings! That's why you're just like a newborn baby. Because you're a baby, you want attention and you make a fuss, and you cry because you want your tantrums indulged!"

"...Is that so?"

"It is! So don't look so glum. I hear babies grow up fast! As long as you don't give up, I'll support your romance with Kakei-san!"

It was hard to fully grasp Ryoka's unique sensibilities, but I thought I understood what she meant. ...So I'm being treated like a child by my teacher and like a baby by my best friend.

　Their assessments of me felt oddly amusing, and a smile slipped out.

"Thanks. That cheered me up a bit."

Just as I offered my sincere thanks, the train pulled into Ryōka's nearest station.

"See you tomorrow then!"

Waving as she stepped lightly off the train, Ryōka seemed more grown-up than usual. Her change solidified a resolution within my heart.
