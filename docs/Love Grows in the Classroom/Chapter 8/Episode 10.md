Episode Ten: It's Because You're My Teacher That I Like You ―December 2033―

"...Ah, I see. Well, I'm not raising you for your admiration, so it's fine. ...But you're my child, and I never suspected you had a man in your life... I never imagined you'd be attracted to women."

"It's not that. Gender doesn't matter. I fell for her because she's my teacher."

"My daughter's first love being a teacher of the same sex... I'd normally oppose it."

"Even if Mum opposes it, my feelings for Sensei won't waver."

I didn't look away from Mum. As if seeing through the most obvious way to prove my resolve and determination, Mum let out a small sigh.

"...Right, I'm popping to the convenience store."

Watching Mum get out of the car and head inside without waiting for my reply, I leaned back against the seat.

I was incredibly tense and exhausted. But I couldn't run away.

Whether Mum accepted my feelings or not, I would still like the teacher.

But if possible... I wanted the person I cared about... the person I cared about to accept it.

The car door opened. "I'm home," Mum said as she sat in the driver's seat, placed her drink in the holder, then handed me the shopping bag.

Inside were a carton of apple juice and chocolate biscuits shaped like animals.

"These...?"

"You used to like them when you were little, didn't you? Thought you might fancy them."

"Oh... thanks."

I inserted the straw, sipped the apple juice, and realised.

　To Mum, I was still the little girl I’d been back then.

She hadn’t really seen me at all... She didn’t know who I was now.

So her kindness, meant to make me happy, fell flat. Seeing Mum like that, a pang of sadness welled up inside me.

"...Meisa’s eighteen now, isn’t she? I know firsthand that no matter how much your parents oppose it, you’re never going to listen to them."

"... Eh?"

"How could I tell my daughter to have a normal relationship when I was the one who had an affair at eighteen with a man over thirty years older and got pregnant?"

As I blinked in surprise, Mum flashed a self-deprecating smile.

"If you feel that strongly, then go for it. If you like her, pursue her wholeheartedly. You won't let go of love until you've given it your all, and you won't learn unless you fail, right?"

"Mum...! Thank you!"

Whilst she'd always dismissed my opinions with a stern look when discussing my future, the moment she understood I was genuinely in love, she accepted my feelings.

So that's it. For better or worse, Mum is a romantic at heart.

I'd always thought Mum, who prioritised being a woman over being a mother, wasn't motherly at all. I still believe that's one reason I've always found her difficult.

　But right now, her way of thinking saved me.

If she won't deny the feelings I have for my teacher, I don't think I'll ever dislike her again.

"Shall we leave this topic? I haven't eaten anything since morning and I'm feeling rather faint. I grabbed some bread from the convenience store – want some, Meisa?"

"I suppose I will. ...Hey, Mum. There's something I've been wondering about... Were you... in the middle of putting on your make-up?"

　Ever since Mum came to school, it had bothered me. Mum, who always leaves the house with perfect makeup, seemed to have nothing on her eyes.

Checking her face in the rear-view mirror, Mum let out a small gasp.

"Oh no! Blimey! I completely forgot! The form teacher rang suddenly, I got a fright and rushed out of the house in a panic. ...Ugh, this is awful. I've never made such a blunder before."

The fact she was so flustered she forgot her precious makeup might prove how much she cares about me. My cheeks relaxed.

"It's fine, you look lovely as usual. Work? Are you taking the day off?"

"Yes. I've already told them I'm leaving it to Nao-chan today. ...Ugh, I can't believe I was walking around looking like this!　...Hey, Meisa, I fancy omurice for dinner. Make it for me. The kind with runny egg."

Doesn't it ever occur to her to make it herself? But I'd grown able to accept these careless sides of Mum too.

I understand now that you don't fall for perfect people.

"I can't be bothered going out to buy ingredients and make it now. Since we're out, let's eat out tonight. Let's go out for some proper delicious omelette rice!"

"Fine, but I'm going home first. I'm going to wear heavier make-up than usual...!"

Somehow, I'd become able to voice my selfish desires to Mum without hesitation. I no longer fidgeted nervously or watched her expression when speaking.

It felt like the world before my eyes had opened up.

I felt like I understood what I could do for Sensei.
