Episode Thirteen: The Battle Connecting to the Future ―December 2033―

"No... whatever you say, you haven't actually stated the crucial point clearly, have you? Unless you tell us plainly whether you like the same sex or not, we can't rest easy."

That man again...! I was truly reaching my limit with his rude questions trampling on the teacher's wishes.

"I am..."

"That is a question I feel the teacher does not need to answer."

The headmaster gently cut off the teacher's attempt to respond and addressed the man.

"That question is inappropriate, even coming from a parent. While Kakei-san's actions were problematic, I don't believe she needs to declare her sexual orientation here. Moreover, our school prides itself on embracing diversity. As long as it doesn't break the law or cause trouble for others, we won't interfere with our students' makeup, piercings, bringing smartphones, or romantic interests."

　Only the middle-aged man grumbled at the headmaster's dignified statement, but finding no supporters, he finally fell silent.

I found myself re-evaluating the headmaster. I'd thought I disliked their old-fashioned ways of thinking, but perhaps that was just my own prejudice.

Thank you, Headmaster. For protecting Kakei-san.

Another reason why I'm glad I came to this school.

　The parents' meeting concluded without incident. The decision on the teacher's disciplinary action would be announced at a later date.

I've decided. If the teacher has chosen the path to remain a teacher, then I'll choose mine too.

It's not elimination. It's the wish I truly desire.

　　　　　　　　　　☆

Subsequently, the school imposed a three-month suspension on the teacher. However, it was made clear that upon returning, they would undoubtedly be transferred to another school.

　I wouldn't see the teacher in this school building again until graduation. Because of the leave period, the teacher wouldn't be able to attend the graduation ceremony either.

Of course, I felt a pang of loneliness, but I was looking forward.

If the teacher could continue being a 'teacher' somewhere, that alone was enough for me.

Days spent silently facing my desk, diligently studying. I couldn't let the path the teacher had opened for me close because of me. ...No, perhaps that sounded a bit too idealistic.

Simply, for my own sake. For the dream that had sprouted within me... or perhaps ambition would be a better word. To realise that, I resolved to diligently and passionately tackle everything I could manage right now.

Cutting off my retreat with sincerity and resolve, striving wholeheartedly towards the future – it felt tense, but it worked for me.

　Both the Common Test and the first-term exams saw me perform beyond my usual capabilities.

　　　　　　　　　　☆

Time flows at the speed of light.

After the graduation ceremony without our teacher, we decided to go out together as a class one last time.

While everyone was getting into the swing of things at karaoke, when I got up to go to the loo... Aimi followed me.

"Um, well, Meisa..."

Aimi looked apologetic. ...Though it might have been an act.

I hadn't spoken to her since the photo with the teacher spread. She was one of the friends who distanced herself, suspecting I was in 'that kind of relationship' with the teacher.

"I'm sorry, Meisa. I didn't know how to treat you... I acted in ways that hurt you, didn't I?"

"It's fine, I don't mind. Everyone has their own values on that sort of thing."

Honestly, it was already over for me. It didn't matter anymore.

Some people can't even imagine same-sex relationships, or even find them repulsive. Forcing opinions like "Be tolerant. It's an age of diversity" onto them feels like harassment, or just plain tacky.

"Ah. But listen, I just want you to understand this one thing."

Whatever Aimi thought of me, I didn't care.

"I really like Kakei-san. I respect her as a person."

I wanted her to accept this one undeniable truth, even if she couldn't accept me. That's why I said it, proudly, with my chest out.

"...Right, I understand."

Aimi didn't seem flustered or try to make light of it; she just nodded deeply.

That was a relief. If she'd pressed further, teased me, or rubbed our differing values in my face, I think we'd have drifted apart after graduation.

Perhaps consciously trying to change the mood, Aimi brought up another topic. "Speaking of which..."

"Did you hear about Kō, Meisa?"

"Ah, yeah. He's an absolute idiot, honestly."

I'd only heard about it from Suzuka the other day, partly because I'd been focused on my exams, but Kō, or more precisely, Kō and a few of his friends, had apparently been suspended at the end of last year and had their university admissions, secured through comprehensive selection, revoked.

　It wasn't because he'd spread the photo of me and the teacher. That alone wouldn't affect an already confirmed acceptance.

The reason it escalated into a major issue was, on the day Wataru let his friends use his phone and the photo leaked, the fact that the boys present had been drinking.

...Perhaps thinking I'd confront him about it, Wataru didn't confess to drinking when he came to apologise. Utterly ridiculous.

　The sense of liberation after exams and the alcohol probably made everyone, including Kō, lose control. But if photos of me and the teacher could spread, it was entirely plausible that pictures of them drinking could circulate too.

I wonder why they even took photos of themselves drinking. Their thinking must have been impaired.

Aimi gave a wry smile.

"It was fortunate it was still within the general entrance exam period. Kō hadn't studied at all after passing the comprehensive selection, and he was lamenting not getting into his desired private university in the end."

I hadn't paid enough attention to Kō's future plans to know, but he has a tendency to impose his ideals on others, and I suspect he'll harbour resentment over not getting into his preferred university. ...I reckon he's in for a rather turbulent university life.

　...It might sound cold, but I'm no saint and I can't feel sorry for him. We're completely unrelated now anyway, so I couldn't care less.

"Oh, I see. But it's good your path's decided, isn't it? I'm still waiting for my results, so I'm all fidgety every day."

"Meisa, let us know when you find out! We'll have a party together!"

"Are you assuming I won't fail?"

"Nah, if you do, it'll just be a consolation party."

"What's that supposed to mean? Say something more encouraging about me getting in!"

I still sensed this invisible rift between us, but I felt we'd returned to being friends who could joke around and relax with each other.

"So, Meisa, which schools did you apply to in the end?"

"I agonised over it, but... …………"

My teacher would surely be pleased to see me discussing the future with my friend. That's why I can keep walking without stopping.

...But you know, Teacher. I think you know this, but I'm a woman who refuses to give up easily.

――Because the fire in my heart hasn't gone out yet. Be prepared.
