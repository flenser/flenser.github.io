Episode 12: Parent-Teacher Meeting ―December 2033―

The day of the parent-teacher meeting.

First thing in the morning, I hung around outside the staff room and managed to catch Masuda-san arriving for work – the teacher whom Kakei-san had said she trusted.

"Masuda-san... um, when Kakei-san pops into the staff room for today's meeting, would it be possible for you to discreetly pass her this letter?"

　Saying it aloud made me realise just how audacious my request was.

"Of course, I'd be happy to."

Surprisingly, Masuda-san agreed without hesitation.

"Are you sure? Really? I feel a bit awkward asking, but won't this be problematic for you, Masuda-san?"

"Oh, how thoughtful of you, Uehara-san. Hehe, it'll be fine. You're not the first student to ask me for a favour concerning Kakei-san."

"Eh? What do you mean?"

"There's a petition circulating among the first and second years, spearheaded by Ogata-san from Class 1-2, asking 'Please don't make Kakei-san resign'. Quite a number have signed it. We plan to hand the collected signatures to the headmaster today, before the briefing session."

"...I see. That's surprising..."

"I heard the third-years are holding back because of their upcoming entrance exams. It's only natural you didn't know. But Kakei-sensei is more beloved than you realise. ...This too is surely the result of the trust she's built up over time."

Realising how deeply cherished sensei was by so many students, I felt my eyes well up with emotion.

　—It's alright, sensei. Your hard work truly reaches the students.

So... do your best today.

"Thank you, Masuda-san."

After politely thanking her, Masuda-san, usually so calm and composed, suddenly flashed a smile as innocent as a child's.

"Now then, Uehara-san? You're not part of the invited students, are you?"

"No, I'm not..."

As I tilted my head in response, Masuda-san whispered softly, revealing a certain scheme.

　　　　　　　　　　☆

That same day after school, the school held a parents' information session.

　The attendance rate seemed lower than expected. Empty seats were conspicuous among the prepared folding chairs. Given the topic, apparently an explanation regarding a young female teacher who had driven around with a female student late at night, perhaps parental interest was thin.

Still, the school had held the meeting because, in this SNS era, attempting to conceal even minor incidents risks sparking malicious rumours and escalating into a major scandal.

　It felt like they were using the teacher as a scapegoat to demonstrate to the outside world that the school was handling and punishing this minor incident, not something that would make national news like drunk-driving, murder, or a male teacher committing indecent acts against a female student, with sincerity.

Now, why can I speak as if I actually saw the attendance rate? Because I did see the state of the venue with my own eyes.

　I'm currently hiding in a storage room within the gymnasium. Amidst the flurry of preparations for the meeting, Masuda-san slipped me in here discreetly.

I suspect getting caught would be far worse than a stern telling-off... but I simply couldn't bear to stay cooped up at home, so I'm eternally grateful to Masuda-san.

And so, the meeting commenced right on schedule.

　At the head of the long table stood the headmaster, the deputy head, the form teacher, the year head... and at the far left, Kakei-san. The deputy head smoothly explained the reasons and circumstances leading to this briefing, offered an apology, and then all the teachers bowed their heads in unison.

Shortly after, a Q&A session was held. The opinions voiced by the attending parents seemed roughly split between those defending the teacher and those criticising her.

"They're both women, so surely the teacher didn't have any improper intentions? Still, if the distance between teacher and pupil becomes too close, I fear it could lead to the very sexual offences we dread most."

"I believe the teacher in question was simply concerned for the female pupil walking alone at night and offered to walk her home. The real issue is that it's become normal for female pupils to work part-time until 10 pm. How does the school regulate part-time work rules?"

　Perhaps because they were slightly older, having married and raised children themselves, many seemed unable to conceive of women forming romantic relationships with each other.

"We parents can't possibly know what feelings a teacher harbours towards a female student. But if she took her out with improper intentions, she betrayed the trust of a student who felt safe getting into her car precisely because they were the same sex. That would be an unforgivable act for an educator."

"To even consider making advances towards someone of the same sex, especially a minor, is utterly unbelievable. It's no wonder people suspect they became a teacher for that very purpose. This calls into question the calibre of our educators. Trust in all the teachers at this school has plummeted significantly. I want to know what kind of education they intend to provide going forward."

Even so, people who condemned the teacher inevitably emerged. Every time a parent voiced criticism of the teacher, my heart felt like it would tear apart.

　—They know nothing. They understand nothing about the teacher, yet they lightly trace a single incident and presume to pontificate.

Anger and frustration swelled within me.

Though the microphone made the speaker's voice clear, from the storeroom I couldn't see anyone's face, couldn't discern a single expression.

Frustration made me clench my fists.

　I’d always thought age gaps and positions could be overcome, but now I realise how naive that was.

I’ve always been the one to be protected. In situations like this, it’s the teacher who ends up taking the brunt and shouldering the responsibility.

“What do you say? Didn’t Kakei-san actually have ulterior motives towards the female student, which is why she offered to drive her home?　Or do you offer lifts to any student in the same manner?"

I felt an urge to slap the man who had stood up to ask that question.

Whatever answer the teacher gave, this bloke was clearly intent on condemning her.

"I sincerely apologise for causing concern to all the parents and guardians. I offered my apologies at the outset, but I would like to express my regret once more."

　Hearing the teacher's voice over the microphone, I held my breath.

The teacher's flat tone and plain appearance seemed to embolden the man, who was itching to criticise her.

"You don't look like you're sorry at all. So, what's the real story? Aren't you actually 'that sort' of person, thinking you might get your hands on a female student if you got the chance?"

　Honestly, give it a rest, you old codger. I desperately held back my anger, trusting the teacher and enduring it silently.

The atmosphere of all the parents in the hall focusing their attention on the teacher reached me too.

"To avoid any misunderstanding, let me state this clearly here. As a teacher, as an adult, I have never done anything to harm the dignity of a female student, nor have I ever given special treatment to any particular pupil."

　The parents began murmuring in unison; several raised their hands, shouting questions and emotional outbursts. Yet the teacher continued with unwavering resolve.

"However, I deeply regret my thoughtless actions as a teacher. I sincerely apologise for causing distrust amongst students, parents, and school staff. It was entirely my lack of foresight."

My heart was full.

　The teacher's words confirmed that they had read my letter.

"While there may be questions about suitability, I truly love this work. I stand at the lectern with pride, and witnessing children grow brings me the greatest happiness. If I may be so bold as to express a wish, I hope to continue serving as a teacher."

　――My feelings had reached the teacher.

It truly made me happy that the teacher fought with words, using every skill, to continue teaching in the future – even when met with distrustful stares and amidst voices of condemnation.
