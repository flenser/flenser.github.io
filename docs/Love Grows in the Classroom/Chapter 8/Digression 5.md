Interlude ⑤ Ryōka, Seventeen — February 2033 —

February 14th. After school, Ryōka was on a date with Sōma at a family restaurant.

"Here you go."

Getting drinks from the self-service bar, including Ryōka's, was always Sōma's job.

　Sōma always made sure Ryōka sat at the back table, took the lead in ordering, and after leaving the restaurant, he would hold her hand and walk her home without fail.

He was kind, thoughtful, tall, and had a handsome face... It wasn't just her biased view as her girlfriend; she genuinely thought Sōma was a total hottie, no matter how you looked at him. To girls of her generation, he was undoubtedly the kind of boyfriend they'd envy.

"Listen, this is Valentine's chocolate... would you take it?"

Handing Sōma the paper bag she'd been carrying all along, filled with chocolates, his expression lit up instantly.

"Thank you, Suzuka! I'm absolutely thrilled!"

"It might not be very tasty... but it's made with loads of love, you know ♡"

Seeing Sōma genuinely delighted, even though he surely knew she'd give it to him, made her feel it was worth the effort to make it by hand. It wasn't a lie. Still... making just this one had taken a lot of time and effort, and it certainly hadn't been enjoyable. If possible, next year she'd rather just give him something bought.

"It couldn't possibly be bad! Homemade chocolate from a girlfriend is something special for a guy! Can I call you tonight?"

"Yeah, sure. I'll be waiting."

"For a guy." I know plenty of people don't feel that way, but Sōma seems utterly convinced his own thoughts are synonymous with the general consensus.

　It was a trait I’d noticed even before we started dating.

I always thought his confidence was charming, but lately I’d started questioning it more often.

　Just as they were leaving the shop, a group of schoolgirls came in. Among them was one girl wearing slacks. While they weren't yet adopted at Minami Ayakawa High School, Ryōka had heard that more and more schools, both junior high and high, were offering the choice between a skirt or slacks when purchasing uniforms.

Ryōka accepted this era of diversity. Or rather, it might be closer to say she didn't think much of it.

"There are more girls in trousers these days, aren't there?"

Sōma remarked, having watched the girl pass by.

"Yeah. It's good they can choose. I don't always fancy wearing a skirt either."

She felt this especially on freezing cold days or when her stomach hurt. Sōma gave a wry smile at Ryōka, who hadn't been seeking agreement but had simply voiced her thoughts.

"Really? I'd rather you wore skirts, Ryōka."

She adored Sōma, but sometimes, just sometimes, a faint sense of unease would surface, something she couldn't quite shake.

Well, his comment was just a personal preference. It felt wrong to complain, so she pressed her lips together.

　If she could have kept ignoring this unease forever, perhaps Sōma would still be by Ryōka's side now.

　　　　　　　　　　＊

Ryōka was a seventeen-year-old third-year high school student, living in a present overflowing with choices, whether she looked up, to the side, or ahead.

Even amidst these fulfilling days, romance had particularly made Ryōka shine, becoming her vitality for living.

But that didn't mean she was without anxiety.

　At this age, if she became too absorbed in romance and neglected everything else, what would remain in Ryōka's hands if she lost Sōma?

She didn't want to live by calculation. If she could always act according to her heart, that would be truly wonderful.

But she was seventeen. One couldn't become an adult by consuming only sweet things.

So today, too, Ryōka was actively wrestling with her thoughts.

　Because it's a problem she can't solve alone, her waning energy is doubled.

What was happening at Sōma's house wasn't lovers' caresses, but a heavy-hearted discussion about the future.

"I first went there on the school trip and thought, 'This is it!' I can't suppress this feeling that I want to spend my university life in Hokkaido, and if anything, it's getting stronger every day."

"But Hokkaido is too far. Can't you go to a university within the Kanto region? Then we could see each other at least once a week."

This discussion, knees pressed together with Sōma, had been repeated countless times already.

And every single time, they reached a deadlock, never finding a solution.

It wasn't a discussion to find a compromise; it was because either Ryōka or Sōma would have to give up.

"...I like you, Suzuka. I want to be with you forever."

"Me too. I love you, Sōma-kun."

"Then why Hokkaido? Are you really okay with us being apart for four whole years?"

Where Sōma's affection would normally make her heart flutter, it now felt like it was being torn apart.

"...Has it never occurred to you that you could come to Hokkaido?"

　Sōma faltered for a moment. That, she realised, was her answer.

"Well... no. I decided ages ago to go to university in Tokyo. My family and friends are all here..."

"Right, I see. ...So you don't feel like compromising yourself, Sōma-kun. You think I should be the one to adjust."

"No. I didn't say that."

"Right, you didn't. You're kind, Sōma-kun, so you'd never say anything I'd dislike, and you're considerate. But... I understand. The longer we're together, the more often I just know. Pretending not to notice is exhausting for me. ...I'm tired."

It wasn't a statement about giving up on her desired path. It signified that she had "given up" on continuing her relationship with Sōma.

　Soma, faced with the words of parting, lost his voice, and a sorrowful silence fell between them.

It was a silence entirely different from the sweet one before a kiss, and a pain unlike any she'd ever felt before gripped Suzuka's chest.

"...I don't want it to end like this."

"Me neither. I still like you. I really do."

"Why can't it work out when we both like each other?"

"... Probably because we're third-year high school students. If we were younger, or more grown-up, maybe... we could have found a better way forward."

Tears streamed down her face, unstoppable.

Seeing tears welling in Sōma's eyes made her cry even harder.

How long did they cry for? By the time the two of them, their faces dry, looked at each other, they had already resolved to part.

"...This is the first time I've ever cried this much in front of a girl. How pathetic..."

"It's not pathetic at all! You're always cool, Sōma-kun!"

When Ryōka cried, when she felt lonely, when she sought affection.

Sōma's large hands, which would normally reach out to touch Ryōka, did not extend this time.
