Episode Two: Their Choice ―July 2033―

Perhaps it would be calmer for you if I didn't show my face.

But according to Suzuka, I'm still a baby when it comes to love. So I'll prioritise my own selfishness.

　—I'm sorry, Sensei. This is the last time. I'll draw a line under things, my way.

There's a resolve and words I absolutely must convey to Sensei.

I opened the messaging app, took a deep breath. Nervously, I sent a message for the first time in about two weeks.

'Could we meet briefly to talk?'

I used polite language to emphasise I was maintaining boundaries.

‘That’s fine. How about tomorrow after school?’

An hour later, I felt relief that a reply had come. Yet at the same time, my chest ached as if it were being squeezed.

Because I knew this day would be the day I parted ways with the teacher.

　　　　　　　　　　☆

The place for our talk with the teacher was, of course, the second elective classroom in the west building.

　This was where the story had always been written.

The one-to-one tutoring sessions, my desire to know more about her, being held in her arms, and... being rejected – it all happened in this classroom.

I waited nervously inside the classroom, arriving before her. Several minutes passed.

"My apologies for keeping you waiting."

Hearing that flat tone and seeing that beautiful face after so long nearly stopped my heart.

Seeing her makes me realise. That my heart races at her face, her voice, her scent, her aura. At everything that makes up her.

But today's purpose isn't to confess my feelings. I straightened my back and faced her.

"I'm sorry, Sensei. Making time for me when you're so busy."

The seat closest to the lectern. Somehow, it had become my special seat – the prime spot nearest to Sensei.

But today, I didn't sit in my usual place. I stood beside Sensei at the lectern. It was my selfish desire to speak while meeting her gaze.

I burned the features of Sensei's face, visible from this close distance, into my eyelids.

"No, it's fine. You have something important to say, don't you?"

The teacher's words were always concise. Not because she was cold, but because she was an incredibly kind yet terribly awkward person – something I now understood perfectly well.

"Yes. Well, first, let me apologise. ...I was only thinking about myself and didn't consider your position at all. I'm truly sorry."

Having resolved to apologise first, I bowed deeply. I felt I absolutely had to apologise for trampling on the feelings of a teacher who valued me as a student.

"No... I also spoke out of turn. I apologise. I realise I acted immaturely towards a student."

The teacher bowed at an angle that made me feel almost guilty.

"Are you perhaps wondering why I came to apologise, sensei?"

My remark made her start and look up, which amused me so much I laughed.

"...How did you know? ...After hurting you so badly, I never imagined you'd apologise."

"I know. I've been watching you all this past year."

　The words slipped from my lips as naturally as breathing, words far removed from my purpose today.

Blimey. I need to cover that... I thought, but the teacher looked less confused than somehow resigned, so I kept quiet.

"...I always thought my thoughts didn't show on my face. All my life, people've said 'I can never tell what you're thinking', yet with you, Uehara-san, I often felt you could read my mind... I see. Now I understand why."

　—Ah, adorable. I like it. I love it. If I could, I'd tell you how I feel just like before, innocently, without holding back.

I want to pour out every last bit of this feeling, which feels like it might spill over any moment, to you.

...But no. I mustn't make a mistake. I don't want to see that look on your face again.

"Ryōka... she broke up with Fuwa."

My heartbeat quickened as I finally broached the subject.

"...Is that something I'm allowed to hear about?"

"I got Ryōka's permission, so it's fine. ...Hey, do you remember? Last year, when we went on our school trip to Hokkaido, Ryōka said she really liked it there."

"Yes, I remember."

"Ryoka agonised over it, but she realised she still wanted to go to university in Hokkaido. So she had several talks with Fuwa, who wanted to go to university in Tokyo. They're both the type who want to be together all the time, and they absolutely hated the idea of a long-distance relationship."

"...So, as a result of those talks, they chose to break up?"

I nodded quietly.
