Episode Two: Ogata-san's Consultation ―May 2033―

"I, I'm sorry..."

After school, Ogata-san arrived at the second elective classroom and sat down at the fourth desk from the front on the corridor side, looking rather unsettled.

"There's no one here, you don't need to sit right at the edge like that."

"I, I told you. I don't really want to be seen by people. This seat is just right because people walking down the corridor can't see me."

I fell silent at her quiet protest. It seemed I'd once again uttered words that showed a lack of consideration for others' feelings.

"I'm sorry, I wasn't thoughtful enough. So... was it today's lesson content you didn't understand? Could you get your tablet out..."

"Well, no. Actually, I wanted to discuss something with you, Kakei-san."

...So it wasn't about the lesson content? A discussion?

Despite Ogata-san's serious expression, I was startled and completely flustered.

When Uehara-san told me she "didn't understand the feeling of liking someone," it felt more like an extension of casual conversation than a proper discussion, so that was different.

　Whether it was due to my lack of empathy towards others, or whether I simply seemed incapable of accepting anyone else, from the time I became aware of such things until now as a teacher, I had never once been approached by anyone to discuss their troubles face-to-face.

Therefore, while I was confident it didn't show on my face, inwardly I was quite flustered.

"Ah, well... if you'd like, please do tell me."

I couldn't possibly imagine handling the advice well, but as a teacher, it would be odd to refuse a student without even hearing them out.

Anyway, first things first – let's hear what she has to say. When I sat down beside Ogata-san, she began speaking quietly in a small voice.

"...What I want to discuss is my friendships."

Of all things, this was an area I was hopelessly ill-equipped to handle.

　Seeking advice on friendships from someone like me, who has none, seemed like a complete misjudgement of who to choose... though Ogata-san had no way of knowing about my own social circle.

Still, as a teacher, I couldn't just run away from it from the start.

"Ogata-san, you're always with Toyama-san and Oyama-san, aren't you? All three of you seem to have attended different junior high schools, yet you appear very close."

As her form teacher, I did at least know who she usually spent time with.

　I thought it was just a harmless conversation, meant to gradually unravel her worries. Yet, Ogata-san's face clouded over instantly.

"We seem close, do we..."

"Eh? Um... What do you mean by that?"

I was so confused I could only ask directly. Ogata-san's eyes widened in slight surprise, then she looked down. Did she think I was a cold teacher?

"Well... the truth is, I don't really click with Toyama-san and the others. But they're new friends I made after starting high school, and I hate being alone, so I force myself to go along with their conversations... I think that's why I get so utterly exhausted."

　—If being with them tires you, why not distance yourself? What exactly do you dislike about being alone?

I held back the words that flashed through my mind, sensing she'd be disappointed in me if I voiced them.

I couldn't even offer a simple acknowledgement, unable to grasp a single aspect of Ogata-san's distress. It was a feeling I could never have understood unless she'd shared it directly like this.

　...Memories from my student days flash back. Even now that I'm a teacher, gauging people's feelings still seems far too difficult for me.

"...I'm sorry. I said something rather thoughtless, didn't I, without knowing your circumstances at all."

It was entirely possible my flippant remark, born of complete ignorance, had hurt Ogata-san. Resolving to be more careful with my words, I apologised for my earlier superficial comment.

"It's fine. I'm the one who's strange for not being able to take it at face value when someone said we seemed close. ...I do want to stay on good terms with them if possible, so I often hold back... but somehow, it feels like they're mocking me... Honestly, it's uncomfortable, I suppose."

"...Um, Ogata-san."

"Yes?"

"What do you actually want to do? I can't figure out how to proceed unless you tell me."

　I'd just resolved to choose my words carefully. But listening to her, Ogata-san's intentions were so unclear that I ended up sounding accusatory.

"...I don't know either. I just wondered... what would you do, Sensei?"

Ogata-san visibly slumped, her voice fading to a whisper.

"If you're being bullied, Ogata-san, then as your teacher I will do everything in my power to protect you. But if it's something else entirely, I'd like you to think about it a little more."

Perhaps thinking I sounded preachy, Ogata-san hadn't met my gaze since.

"It's perfectly fine to talk to someone about your worries to gain perspective. But your worries are yours. You mustn't leave the choice to someone else – to me."

Ogata-san's body seemed to stiffen.

"Having said that, I'll be honest. I'm terribly unaccustomed to people confiding in me. I don't think I'm suited to it, and I doubt I could offer the words you need to push you forward or suggest a way out. Nor, because I struggle to fully grasp your feelings, do I think I could offer the comfort of empathy to ease your burden."

"...Is that so..."

Ogata-san looked sad. I'd probably disappointed her.

　But I simply couldn't bring myself to lie. Any platitudes that came from pretending to be someone I'm not would surely disappoint both Ogata-san and myself.

"However, since I can offer neither suggestions nor empathy, I imagine I'll spend more time agonising alongside you than someone more skilled at counselling. So rather than offering advice, I'd like to think we could agonise together, talk things through, and consider how to make your high school life enjoyable and as stress-free as possible. What do you think?"

　I thought I’d offered the best approach I could manage, but Ogata blinked in surprise... then suddenly smiled. It was a completely unexpected reaction.

"I never imagined you’d respond like that, Kakei-san. It’s... kind of surprising, I guess."

"Superficial, teacherly platitudes wouldn’t help me properly advise someone as important as you."

It’s only natural to want the pupils in one’s class to lead healthy school lives.

"My impression of you, Kakei-san, has changed a little."

"Have I disappointed you?"

Ogata-san straightened her posture and gazed intently into my eyes.

"No, quite the opposite. I think it would be wonderful if we could solve this problem together, Kakei-san. ...Would you mind helping me?"

"Of course. Let's do our best to create an environment where you can concentrate on your studies."

I'm sure I won't be able to advise Ogata-san skilfully.

But I have no choice but to give my all for a student who has placed their trust in me.

The responsibility is immense. Feeling the weight of responsibility for being chosen as her confidante, I resolved to find a way to resolve this for the better.
