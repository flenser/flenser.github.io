Episode Seven: It's Alright ―June 2033―

I ended up taking Uehara-san home with me.

Though I know full well this is utterly unbecoming of a teacher, I realise that now, it's merely a thought in my head, and the sense of transgression has faded compared to before.

Lying sprawled on the sofa, I stared blankly at Uehara-san moving her hands deftly in the kitchen.

　Uehara-san is kind, affectionate, and adorable. Ask anyone, and I think they'd say she's a wonderful person.

If only she weren't a student. If only she were an adult.

I'm now tormented by my own words from that time, the ones that gave her strength: "This relationship is fine as it is."

I couldn't help but think... if only she weren't a student.

"It should last at least a week. I'll come back to make more when the frozen portion runs out, so do let me know anytime."

Uehara-san, who'd swiftly finished preparing several dishes with her skill, placed tonight's portion of fried rice on the table.

"...It looks delicious. I'll tuck in now."

As I reached for a spoonful of the piping hot fried rice, my distracted attention caused me to knock over a glass. The oolong tea inside spilled onto Uehara-san's skirt and thigh.

"I'm so sorry...! Are you alright⁉"

"Ahaha, it's absolutely fine, don't worry about it? Could you lend me a towel or something, Sensei?"

Uehara-san laughed without any sign of anger or exasperation, while I was in a complete panic. Perhaps because of this, when I rushed to the changing room to fetch a towel and returned, I tripped over nothing.

"Whoa!"

"Sensei!"

Just as I was about to fall, Uehara-san caught me, preventing me from hitting the floor. However, I ended up leaning over her, who had lost her balance.

When our eyes met, with her directly beneath me, I could no longer remain calm.

　Her long hair scattered across the floor. Her skirt yielding to gravity. Her white thighs exposed. Her flushed cheeks.

...The thing I'd suppressed all this time overflowed.

Though I should have been flustered, I touched her cheeks, stained crimson.

Considering what I was about to do, if she suspected I'd done it deliberately, it would be my own fault.

　But surely, she wouldn't refuse. She would accept me.

"…………It's fine."

The heated breath emitted from such close proximity instantly robbed me of my reason.

If I were to seek her out of my own volition even once, I... no, we would lose everything.

Even knowing that, I was about to be swallowed whole by the irresistible desire before me.

　Even as I drew closer, her large eyes remained fixed on me.

Enough. I resolved to disregard all common sense and social propriety, to take her.

"...Sensei..."

—Just a moment ago, I was certain that was what I wanted.

That single word instantly sobered me.

The blood drained from my entire body. ...What on earth was I trying to do to her... to a student?

Wasn't that an act I absolutely must not commit "as a teacher"?

I sat up, unable to meet Uehara-san's gaze, weighed down by guilt, and bowed my head.

"...I'm sorry. I... I... tried to do something utterly unbecoming of a teacher to you..."

The unease I'd vaguely felt before had been confirmed.

　Being alone with Uehara-san.

Driving her to and from study sessions.

Eating meals together at home.

...Touching her.

I knew that growing accustomed to this closeness would eventually numb my senses, leaving me unable to return.

Following my instincts, drifting towards comfort, has led to this disastrous state.

"Don't apologise, Sensei."

As if sensing my likely pallor, Uehara-san gently took my hand. When I looked up, she wore a serious expression.

"If that's what you want, Sensei, I'll be by your side no matter what."

Truly, she was too good for someone like me to have fallen for me.

　—Precisely because of that, I absolutely must not be the one to rob her of her future.

"...Please forget about today. I was tired and not myself. ...I'll walk you home. Thank you for dinner."

Uehara-san didn't press me about my cowardice in ending the conversation so selfishly.

Once again, I'd made the pathetic mistake of leaning on her, someone so skilled at reading people's hearts.

　After seeing Uehara-san home, I collapsed onto the sofa, utterly unable to move.

I felt nothing but disgust for my own foolishness – wasting the time of Uehara-san, a student preparing for entrance exams, by pursuing her, a minor.

Switch gears completely. Atone for your sins.

I held no doubt that helping Uehara-san improve her academic performance and gain university admission was the only, and greatest, way I could make amends.
