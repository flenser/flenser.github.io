Episode Seven: Jealousy ―July 2032―

Today is the final day of the extra lessons.

It was only a week. A week ago, I just thought it was a bother and wished it would end quickly. Why is that?

Now, I feel a little sad that the extra lessons with the teacher are ending.

Waking up in the morning, going to school, going to my part-time job, hanging out. The extra lessons that slipped into this daily routine were just another irregularity at first.

I find myself laughing at this. In just one week, human feelings can change this much.

"Uehara-san? Are you concentrating?"

"Yeah, I'm doing it properly. Just a bit more and I'll be done."

The final day is the make-up test. Whether it's because my brain works well or the teacher's teaching was good, Within thirty minutes of starting, I'd nearly finished the test, even having time to think about other things.

My motivation was seeing the teacher's surprised face and wanting praise, driving me to aim for full marks.

Just one problem left. Once I solved this, once this extra class ended, I would...

"Ah... Kakei-san, may I speak with you?"

　Startled, I looked up at the sudden intrusion of a third voice into our private space. At the front door of the classroom, the entrance closest to the teacher, stood a female student.

It was Tadano-san from Class 4. I knew her face and name, but we were different types and had no interaction; she wasn't someone I'd call a friend.

The eyes peeking out from Tadano-san's long black fringe glanced briefly at me before turning back to the teacher. She didn't seem inclined to leave, but it was supplementary lessons now, and the earnest teacher would surely send her away.

"Excuse me, Uehara-san, please carry on."

I almost blurted out, "Eh?" Prioritising Tadano-san over me? What was that about? Wasn't that odd? Was she discussing something so important?

"I thought I should tell the teacher first..."

　—Well, that’s splendid. Tadano-san’s persistence in persuading the librarian paid off…

My mind was elsewhere; I couldn’t focus on the problems at all. From the bits I caught, it seemed the book Tadano-san had requested for the library had finally arrived? She wanted to tell the teacher, who shared her taste in authors, first… that sort of thing, I suppose.

But seriously, is that something you need to come and discuss during extra lessons?　It doesn't seem like such an urgent matter to me?

But the teacher's face when she was told was absolutely beaming. I'd never realised the teacher was such a book lover.

...What is this feeling? It's not pleasant. Or rather, isn't this supposed to be my time with you?

As I was about to write down 'the sorrow of losing a child' as the answer to the final question in the Tosa Diary, my hand froze.

　Is this feeling I have now because I'm sad that the teacher prioritised Tadano-san over me? That doesn't quite fit, or rather, it feels wrong. It's not like I feel like crying or hate everything, that sort of feeling.

How should I put it... I want her to prioritise his time with me. I want her to put me first.

—I want me to be the student the teacher cherishes most.

　That feels closest to what I'm feeling... but if that's the case, doesn't that make me terribly selfish?

When I was talking with Suzuka about suspecting Fuwa of cheating, I thought Suzuka was being "a bit too selfish". So then... is this feeling – selfish, self-centred, blatantly possessive – what "jealousy" really is?

　The moment I realised it, my face flushed hot all at once.

I'm not even dating the teacher, so what gives me the right to feel jealous? It makes me feel like a child who thinks they're the centre of the universe, and it's embarrassing.

...But why her? She's seven years older, she's an adult, and... well, she's a woman, for starters.

　Listening to Ryōka's story must have tangled things up somewhere inside me. Maybe her romantic feelings for Fuwa got crossed with this strange feeling I have towards my teacher.

Because... there's no way I could possibly be in love with my teacher.

"Uehara-san, time's up."

The teacher's voice snapped me back to reality. I realised Tadano-san was gone, and the test time had ended.

"Eh? No way! It's over? Give me five more minutes!"

"No, I'm collecting them now. ...Ah, but you've filled in all the answer boxes except the last question. I'll mark it, so please wait a moment."

I stole a glance at the teacher mercilessly collecting the answer sheets as he marked them. Until a week ago, I'd only thought of her as a plain, serious, boring teacher, but now my impression of her had changed just a little.

I thought she had rather pretty features, she seemed incredibly sincere about her lessons, and occasionally, her mature side would unsettle me...

What exactly were these feelings I had towards the teacher?

I didn't know. I didn't know, but I hated feeling this confused and unsettled.

"Uehara-san, that's brilliant. You scored ninety-five in the resit. Only the final question was left blank – was it too difficult?"

The teacher, clearly pleased, handed me my exam paper after marking it.

"I just got a bit spaced out and ran out of time. It's perfectly solvable."

I quickly filled in the blank answer. The teacher nodded and circled it in blue.

"Correct. Seems you won't need the explanation after all. Such a shame about that mistake. Focus properly for the next test, won't you?"

"Yes, sensei. I'll try my best."

"Right then, that concludes the extra tuition. You've worked very hard this week, Uehara-san."

Seeing the teacher's gentle smile, my mouth moved of its own accord.

"...Hey, sensei? Why don't you sit next to me?"

　Without asking why, the teacher complied with my random, selfish request and sat down silently beside me.

The usual dynamic of looking up at the teacher standing at the lectern was disrupted. The blurring of the boundary between 'teacher and pupil' strangely made my cheeks relax.

"If I'd been born seven years earlier, we'd have been classmates. Do you think we could have been friends then?"

"If we had been classmates, I doubt you would even have known my name, Uehara-san."

"Eh? You don't have a bad impression of me, do you?"

"Not at all. But you were always alone."

"I do talk to people properly! You're the one who didn't want anything to do with me, weren't you?"

"That's not true. But I felt our current relationship was fine as it was."

"...Why?"

"Precisely because I'm your teacher, I've been able to learn so much about you. I know you probably disliked it... but I enjoyed both the extra lessons and our chats afterwards."

Seeing the teacher smile as she said this, I felt confused yet resolved something within myself.

I want to know more about the teacher.

I don't know what this feeling is, but if thinking about it won't tell me, I decided to act until I understood.
