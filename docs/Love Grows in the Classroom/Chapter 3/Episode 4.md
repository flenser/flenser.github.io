Episode Four: I Have No Idea — July 2032 —

The next day, the topic turned to a popular good luck charm among my friends.

"Why don't you try this too, Sensei? They say if you put this person on your phone's home screen, your romantic fortune improves."

The smartphone screen I presented to Sensei like a treasure box displayed a blonde woman in pink clothing.

　A frown creased the teacher's brow.

"This is Macau-san, the commentator, isn't it? Seeing such a flamboyant person every time I look at my phone would be rather exhausting."

"But it seems to work. I'm doing it, and all my friends around me are too."

"Has it worked for you, Uehara-san?"

"...Not so far."

　No man I could fancy has appeared, and Kou is still clinging to me as ever. I can't say my romantic prospects have improved so far.

"Well then, do let me know if it works for you, Uehara-san."

"Ah, you don't believe it at all, do you?"

The teacher chuckled softly.

"Uehara-san, you're surprisingly childish, aren't you?"

I flinched at the mischievous glint in her eyes, a look I'd never seen before, teasing me. During lessons, she’s like a Noh mask, but she can make faces like this too.

I’m usually told I seem quite mature, but I was surprised I didn’t mind being called childish.

"Well, I am more childish than you, but when it comes to nails, makeup, and trendy stuff, aren’t I the one teaching you?"

"That’s true. I’m grateful you’ve taught me so much about worlds I didn’t know. Next week marks the end of the extra lessons. Let's give it our all for these last three days."

Her words reminded me that this time with her was limited.

My reason for seeing her would disappear. One connection with her would vanish. The thought stirred a kind of restlessness within me.

"Eh... You said you'd listen to all sorts of things, but ending it once the extra lessons finish is a bit harsh, isn't it?"

"I'll still listen to you. It's just that I don't have the experience to offer meaningful advice on your troubles, so I doubt it would be very helpful."

She was far more trustworthy than adults who offered condescending advice. Yet, the more my trust in her grew, the more I felt she was pulling away.

"...Did talking to me bother you?"

"I've never once thought it troublesome. What's the matter? Please don't suddenly become upset."

...I hadn't realised at all, but did I look upset just now?

Since the extra lessons began until today, the teacher has repeatedly drawn out emotions within me that I've never experienced before.

It's confusing, but it's not unpleasant. Rather, I even feel a kind of craving for it.

　What on earth is this feeling? I haven't the foggiest. I don't know, but my instincts tell me I can't just leave it unanswered.

Would I understand if I knew more about you, Sensei?

"...Hey, Sensei, why did you decide to become a teacher? You don't exactly seem like the type who likes children."

Unaccustomed to acting on a desire to know someone better, I asked a question that probably made me seem like I'd only just realised.

　But as always, the teacher answered my question sincerely.

"...I had a mentor. My mentor, Hisako-san, was my form teacher in high school. She was truly wonderful. After experiencing her way of thinking and kindness, I developed an aspiration: 'I want to be like Hisako-san.' So, despite being told by others and myself that I wasn't suited to it, I chose the path of teaching. Rather simple, isn't it?"

　Her tone was different now, gentle, yet rich with emotion. That alone made me realise she was speaking of someone dear to her.

Once again, I felt an indescribable emotion towards this 'Hisako-san', a woman possessing such charm and influence she could shape a teacher's entire life.

Unlike before, this feeling was decidedly unpleasant. I couldn't manage a proper response to the teacher who'd taken the trouble to share this with me.

"...I'm sorry. I don't think it will be helpful in deciding your future dreams."

Perhaps my unease showed on my face, for the teacher looked apologetic.

"Sorry, Sensei, that's not what I meant. ...Um, that Hisako-sensei? What kind of teacher is she? Do you still keep in touch?"

"We occasionally have meals together. She's the only person I keep in contact with, as I have neither friends nor a lover."

"…………Hmm…………"

"You do look rather cross, don't you?"

After exchanging another déjà vu-like exchange with the teacher, who gave a wry smile, I left the classroom.
