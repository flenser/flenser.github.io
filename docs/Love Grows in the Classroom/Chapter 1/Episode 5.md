Episode Five: Sasaki Ryōka - November 2032 -

"Hey, Kakei-san's from Kanagawa, right? Is it true people from Kanagawa always say 'Yokohama' when you ask where they're from?"

It seems Sasaki-san also knows quite a lot about me through Uehara-san. ...I wonder just how much she's told her.

"I can only say it depends on the person."

"What a noncommittal answer! See, you really are an adult, Sensei! Amazing!"

As I smiled wryly, completely baffled by what impressed Sasaki-san, Uehara-san looked rather displeased.

"Right, Ryōka. I'm happy you two are getting along, but don't get all lovey-dovey with Sensei."

"This gets labelled as lovey-dovey? That's a bit harsh, isn't it? It's funny though."

Uehara-san had mentioned she'd told Sasaki-san about her feelings for me.

Having romantic feelings for someone of the same sex still belongs to the minority in today's world, I think. That's why I inevitably worry about the gaze from the majority.

Therefore, I've never told anyone about my secret love. I've desperately kept it bottled up inside all this time.

But whether it's the current zeitgeist, a difference in mindset among Uehara-san's generation, or just that they happen to be open-minded girls, I don't know. Still, the fact that Uehara-san told Sasaki-san about her feelings for me was something I could never have imagined doing myself.

"Actually, Meisa, you get like this around people you like, huh? Totally different from how you were with your exes! Adorable~!"

"'Adorable~' isn't the right reaction. How would you feel if I started talking about Ryōka's ex-boyfriend in front of Fuwa?"

"...I'd think, 'What the hell are you saying?' Sorry."

So this is what it means to blurt out whatever comes to mind.

I knew Uehara-san had a boyfriend, and frankly thought it would be odd if she didn't, so I didn't mind. But both Uehara-san and Sasaki-san visibly darkened.

"Ah, um... the second years have their school trip starting next week, don't they? Lovely, Hokkaido. Have you both finished your preparations?"

Perhaps they noticed how wooden my attempt at mediation sounded – me stepping in awkwardly, thinking I ought to act like an adult, like a teacher, and smooth things over.

They exchanged glances and gave a soft laugh.

"Sorry, Sensei. Ryoka's lack of tact is nothing new. Even if I did have an ex, you're the only one I've ever truly liked!"

"Meisa's feelings for Kakei-sensei are genuine, and she's such a lovely girl! Keep any dislike or irritation for me alone!"

"...I'm not particularly bothered about that. I'm just glad you two seem to have made up."

　Is it characteristic of Uehara-san to say 'I like you' without a hint of embarrassment in front of friends? Or are all young people like this nowadays?

"Hey, Meisa, I hear Hokkaido is unbelievably cold. Let's go buy some new clothes. Warm and cute ones!"

"Sounds good, I want to go. But isn't this something we could talk about later? I'll contact you afterwards, so shouldn't you be heading out soon?"

"You just don't get it, Meisa. This is a super assist from your best friend, doubling as an apology for earlier!"

Despite having just been scolded, Sasaki-san pretended not to hear Uehara-san's "get out" and looked at me.

"Hey, Kakei-san, won't you miss Meisa for three whole days?"

"I won't miss her, no. I suppose the school will be quieter without the second-years around."

"Come on, Kakei-sensei, isn't saying 'I'll miss her' – even if it's a lie – just basic adult social courtesy~⁉"

Watching Sasaki-san flustered, Uehara-san was laughing.

"No, no, that sort of thing won't work on the teacher at all."

"But, you see, I've always just seen Meisa chasing after you, so I just... wanted to hear words from Kakei-sensei's mouth that Meisa would like."

"I'm glad, but it's none of your business. I'll manage on my own, I'm fine."

...So why could they discuss this with me standing right there? Feeling unbearably awkward, I looked away from them.

"Right then, Kakei-sensei, I'm off home! Take good care of Meisa!"

"Well, if you say so... Ah, Sasaki-san, why not join the study session as it is?"

"The official line is I don't want to disturb Meisa, but the real reason is I've got a date with Sōma-kun later, so it's impossible! Right then, excuse me~!"

Stunned by the force with which Sasaki-san stormed off,

"Ryōka really is completely straightforward, isn't she?"

Uehara-san said this, flashing what was surely her brightest smile of the day.

　　　　　　　　　　◇

A week later, the second-years set off on their three-day, two-night school trip.

As I wasn't chaperoning, it felt like someone else's business. Yet, afternoons without seeing Uehara-san were surprisingly quiet, and I couldn't deny feeling a touch of loneliness.

On the second night of the trip, a message arrived from Uehara-san in Hokkaido.

'Hokkaido is amazing. So much fun. Wish you could've come, Sensei.'

'Impossible. It's a school event.'

'Well then, how about we go travelling together sometime?'

'We won't.'

I knew my reply was curt, but a teacher and student travelling together? Even if we were the same sex, it was unthinkable.

'When Uehara-san graduates...'

I stopped typing there. After a moment's hesitation, I deleted it all, erasing it from existence.

What on earth was I thinking? With the second-years absent, the lesson schedule had shifted slightly too. Perhaps my usual sense of reality was a bit numb.

　The weather is fine tonight; looking out the window, the stars are clearly visible.

I wonder how the weather is in Hokkaido. Is Uehara-san also looking up at that starry sky, which must be far more beautiful than the one in Saitama?

I hope she enjoys her once-in-a-lifetime high school trip to the fullest. And I hope she returns full of stories to share about her travels.

The second-years will be back tomorrow. I decided to get ready for bed early.
