Episode Four: The Weekly Friday Study Session — November 2032 —

There is a reason why I hold a 'study session' at a fixed time every Friday.

Until quite recently, Uehara-san was the sort of student who would usually turn up at my place on days when she had no plans for part-time work or going out with friends, saying, "Teach me my studies, please ♡".

　As a teacher, I had no reason to refuse when she asked, and I certainly harboured no improper feelings. However, Uehara-san began to worry that other students might perceive this one-to-one tutoring – which wasn't even remedial after failing a test – as favouritism, or that teachers might start to question our relationship.

　Therefore, to prevent any unfounded suspicions from jeopardising my position as a teacher, she spread the word throughout the school: 'Every Friday, in the second elective classroom of the West Building, Kakei-san holds a Japanese language study session'.

However, whether any students would actually participate was another matter entirely.

"Is Uehara-san the only student attending the study session today?"

Theoretically, the study session could accommodate up to thirty-two participants. Yet, apart from Uehara-san, who had taken the seat closest to the lectern, no other students were visible in the classroom.

The study session operated on a self-directed basis: each student worked through their own problem sets, with Uehara-san offering help only when asked about points they didn't understand. The appeal (according to Uehara-san) was that anyone could join regardless of year group or academic stream. Yet, a month after starting the study sessions, even by the fourth meeting, there was not the slightest sign of it becoming popular.

"We are advertising it properly, you know. It's just... well, everyone has compulsory extra lessons or goes to cram schools, so maybe they avoid voluntary study sessions."

　Ayagawa Minami High School is an average institution with an academic ranking around sixty. While it cannot boast of being a top-tier preparatory school with impressive university acceptance rates, the school administration seems keen to boost its first-time university entry rate and has been trialling various initiatives in recent years.

However, I feel the students' mindset remains somewhat complacent – aiming only for safe options rather than challenging themselves for higher-ranked universities, or selecting schools they're likely to get into via comprehensive selection rather than pursuing their preferred institutions.

　That said, it wouldn't be surprising if some students, even lacking motivation, considered attending a study session once if someone popular like Uehara-san invited them.

Yet the fact that they don't gather must be solely because I lack appeal.

I know the students call me behind my back 'a dull, serious, inflexible, boring teacher'.

If another teacher held the study session, perhaps many students would come.

"First-years aside, I really wish the second and third-years would come..."

Once you become an adult, you have to pay money just for the act of being taught and studying. I want the students to use me to improve their academic ability, but I feel sorry that I'm not living up to Uehara-san's efforts.

"No, don't get down about it, Sensei. Even if only my students show up, that's perfectly normal!"

　Even I, who's not great at reading people, noticed from Uehara-san's voice – a shade brighter than usual – that she was trying to reassure me.

"I don't mind not being popular, really. One-on-one makes it easier to guide you, Uehara-san."

"It's fine, you're super popular with me, you know ♡"

"No, I said I'm not feeling down!"

"But, sorry. Let me confess something. Teacher, why do you think I was so stubborn about wanting Friday for the study session?"

"...Because it's the day Uehara-san is free?"

"You're not very perceptive, are you? How do you expect to become a great detective like that?"

Uehara-san made a gesture of stroking a non-existent moustache. What was she trying to say?

"I don't quite follow... What was the reason, then?"

"The reason's simple: lots of kids have plans on Fridays."

"...I see. So you wanted fewer students attending the study session?"

"Correct ♡. I did announce it to the school to show off what you're doing, but ideally I'd prefer it just to be the two of us."

Couldn't this girl channel her intelligence and enthusiasm more towards her studies?

"Plus, I was hoping maybe we could go for a meal after the study session."

"I see. You're quite calculating."

"I'd rather you said I was clever."

"It does feel a bit underhand, though."

"You don't dislike resourceful students, do you?"

Well, that's true, I suppose. Seeing Uehara-san's smile, which could easily be mistaken for provocation, inevitably stirred that thing inside me. I could only clam up, careful not to say anything foolish.

"...Well then, shall we begin the study session?"

"Yaaay!"

Just as Uehara-san pulled her tablet from her bag,

"Meisa's here! I knew it was here!"

A shrill voice pierced the quiet, empty classroom.

　Startled, I turned towards the door where the voice came from. Standing there was Uehara-san's friend, Sasaki Suzuka.

"Suzuka? Eh? What? Something urgent?"

Sasaki-san gave me a bright smile and a slight bow before entering the classroom.

"Sorry for interrupting your time alone with Kakei-san, Meisa! Here, this is the electronic dictionary I borrowed during the elective class earlier. I thought you'd be in trouble if I didn't return it today."

"Ah, I'd forgotten. Thanks."

I know a lot about Sasaki-san from Uehara-san's stories, so I feel like I know her quite well, even if it's one-sided.

She's been in a long-term relationship with Fuwa Sōma-kun, an excellent male student who's well-regarded by teachers. Uehara-san, who tends to have many friends but not very deep relationships, considers Sasaki-san her only true confidante, someone she can trust completely and tell everything to.

　Like Uehara-san, Sasaki-san stands out in this school with her striking appearance, belonging to a group that draws attention. Yet, it seems her personality differs from Uehara-san's.

She's the cheerful type who voices her thoughts immediately, a real mood-maker, though Uehara-san says she sometimes brings trouble along with her.

Sasaki-san's eyes, always giving the impression of boundless curiosity, fixed on me intently.
