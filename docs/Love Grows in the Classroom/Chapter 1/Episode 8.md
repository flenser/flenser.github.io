Episode Eight: Home Visit - November 2032 -

Summarising the prior information from Uehara-san.

Uehara-san was raised in a single-parent household and apparently never knew her father. Her mother currently runs a snack bar in Ōmiya and is often absent from home in the evenings.

　Uehara-san's grandmother constantly told her mother that "education protects you," leading to a childhood immersed in study. However, as a reaction to this strict upbringing, she became pregnant with Uehara-san during her second year of university and dropped out.

"I've led a more fulfilling life since leaving university, and I earn a decent income. Going to university isn't really that meaningful,"

　Apparently, her mother has been imposing this view on her since he was in secondary school.

　　　　　　　　　　◇

Today was finally the day I was to visit Uehara's home to discuss her future path with her mother.

We parked at the nearest paid car park and walked side by side along the path to the house.

"Ah, I feel rather nervous."

Her face tense, Uehara pressed her hand to her chest.

"Since I'll be doing most of the talking, I don't think you need to be quite so nervous."

"...Well, my mum's quite a force to be reckoned with, you know. I wonder if she'll listen to what you have to say... I mean, it's a bit awkward for me to say this as her daughter, but she's seriously a pain."

Her repeated anxious, negative comments weren't meant to frighten me. It was likely her kindness, considering the shock I might receive and wanting me to be mentally prepared.

"Ah, it's absolutely fine. I'll just do my job, regardless of who I'm dealing with."

But I wasn't particularly nervous. I was simply doing what needed doing.

"You're always you, aren't you, Sensei? That's a bit reassuring."

I hadn't meant to say it to encourage her, but Uehara-san's expression had softened.

"What about when you were deciding your own path? When you chose to become a secondary school teacher, were your parents pleased?"

"No, they opposed it. They wanted me to pursue a higher-paying career in the private sector or become a licensed professional."

"Eh, really⁉ I thought being a teacher – a civil servant, no less – would make them happy..."

"Well, values differ from person to person. My parents always aim high, you see."

Ever since I was little, they've been people who demand their own ideals over my abilities or what I want to do. That suffocating feeling was one reason I left home, but it also made me feel strongly that I wanted to help students as much as possible when they struggled or felt lost about their future paths, especially given the unfairness of her parents, starting with Uehara-san.

"Sensei, we're here."

We'd walked while talking and reached her house in no time. I'd thought it before when dropping Uehara-san off once – this old, grandparent-style house felt slightly at odds with her image.

"Right, I'll open it then... I'm home! Mum, the teacher's here."

As Uehara-san opened the front door and called out, patter-patter footsteps drew nearer.

"Welcome home, Meisa. Thank you for coming, Kakei-san."

The woman who came to greet me at the door, standing tall, possessed a youth and beauty that instantly captivated me.

Her lustrous chestnut-brown hair, long and seemingly ageless, her delicate, fair complexion giving her an almost fragile appearance at first glance – yet her perfectly straight posture and composed tone revealed an independent woman.

"Pleased to meet you. I am Kakei Rio, a teacher at Minami High School."

However captivated or surprised I might be, I had to maintain proper greetings as a professional.

Especially today, as my success hinged greatly on whether this person would trust me.

"I'm Meisa's mother. Please, come in, sensei."

Uehara-san's striking appearance was undoubtedly inherited from her mother. The man beside her mother, who was said to be romantically inclined, changed regularly, lending credibility to her claim that there was never a break in their succession.

Overwhelmed by her refined beauty, even from behind, I was shown into the living room. A large wooden table stood there, and I knelt on a cushion. Her mother served tea, so I bowed in gratitude and accepted it.

　Her mother sat opposite us, with Uehara-san seated diagonally in front.

"Once again, thank you for taking time out of your busy schedule today."

"Not at all. I'm terribly sorry to have caused you such trouble, sensei. ...Still, Kakei-sensei, despite your youth, you possess such a remarkably composed bearing. I wish Meisa would take a leaf out of your book."

　Though her words were polite, her gaze felt intrusive, scrutinising me from head to toe, if I may say so. It was likely born of her deep affection for her daughter.

"I'm flattered. Meisa is perfectly composed. While she occasionally needs guidance on her attire or speech, she possesses a core strength and conviction. Her words and actions sometimes astonish me, they seem beyond her seventeen years."

　I wasn't exaggerating my praise just because I was in front of her mother. Speaking my true thoughts, I replied,

"Thank you. Um... I heard from Meisa that you're not her form teacher, are you? What is your relationship with Meisa, and why the home visit?"

Her mother, maintaining a beautiful smile, cut straight to the point.

"I teach Meisa-san's Language and Culture class. She approaches her studies with great diligence. I hold a voluntary study session every Friday for interested students, and Meisa-san attends without fail each week. She's highly motivated and a quick learner, so her grades have been steadily improving."

Even if Uehara-san had less than pure motives for attending the study sessions, the sharp rise in her Japanese language grades was undoubtedly down to her own efforts.

"Classics and Japanese literature, of all things... How shall I put it? They're the subjects least likely to be useful in the future, aren't they?"

Yet without praising Uehara-san's grades, her mother stated this flatly.

It was likely a strategy from the outset: to break my spirit and discourage me from interfering with Uehara-san. Her mother, who had seemingly been wearing a mask until now, suddenly bared her hostility towards me, as if brandishing a razor-sharp knife.

　That attitude, those words, for a moment, I almost retorted. How dare she say "Classics and Japanese literature are useless" in front of a Japanese teacher? I thought her rude, but I held back, knowing this wasn't the place to get angry.

More than that, the real problem was that Uehara-san's efforts weren't being recognised. Just as I opened my mouth to explain how hard she was working,

"Mum, that was rude to the teacher. Apologise."

　Uehara-san clearly rebutted her mother, her voice tinged with anger.

—Is she getting angry for me?

The thought calmed me instantly. I mustn't lose sight of my purpose. For her sake, for her kindness, I must do what I can.

"I'm terribly sorry, sensei. It's purely a personal matter, but I've never liked people in positions of authority. I suppose that makes me a bit aggressive."

　Ignoring Uehara-san's words, Mother smiled and casually uttered something truly frightening.

But at the same time, though it might be rude to say, I also thought she seemed very childish.

"No, I think it's only natural for parents who cherish their child to become aggressive towards someone they don't trust. ...I'd like to thank you once again for giving me, who is not the homeroom teacher, the opportunity to speak with you today."

Bowing my head once more, I looked up at your mother again.

"The only reason I requested this meeting was to discuss Meisa's future path. Mother, are you aware that Meisa has expressed an interest in university?"

Your mother's gaze shifted from me to Uehara-san.

"...Meisa, you want to go to university? Mummy's never heard you mention it before."

"...Um, well. You see... Mum, ever since I was in secondary school, you've always said things like 'university is pointless' or 'we can't afford to send you to university'... right?"

"And?"

"Well, that's why... I actually was a bit interested, but... I just couldn't bring myself to say anything, I suppose..."

Uehara-san's tone lacked its usual composed air. It seemed the topic of further education was a landmine for this beautiful mother. She was adept at reading the room. Precisely because she understood it was a landmine, stepping onto it herself must have been terrifying.

"It seems Meisa-san herself never voiced it, but she always harboured a desire to study at university. Our school is fully equipped to support our students' progression. However, no matter how much we at the school wish to support them, for a high school student to choose their desired path, the understanding and cooperation of their guardians is essential. We need the consent of the mother who has nurtured Meisa so carefully up to this point."

While I was explaining, her mother stared intently at my face. It was a gaze that seemed to say she wouldn't tolerate even the slightest slip of the tongue.

"...Meisa, have you decided on your future dream? Is there something you want to do? Is there something you want to study at university?"

"Well... not yet, I suppose."

Her mother shrugged her shoulders ostentatiously.

"Sensei, what's the point of a child who doesn't even know what they want to do going on to further education?"

"Precisely because she hasn't found what she wants to do yet, I'd like you to consider further education as an option."

"That's the thinking of someone raised in a wealthy family."

Her mother sighed.

"...Excuse me, sensei, what's your educational background?"

"I graduated from Yokohama National University."

"Well, a prestigious university then. You must have received a thorough education from your parents from a young age?"

"Yes. I attended cram school from primary school through to graduating high school, and I went to a private school with a combined middle and high school programme, so I think I was given many opportunities to learn."

Even though I was merely answering her questions, the mother smiled and nodded as if she had come to some personal realisation.

"...Mum? Wh-why are you asking the teacher such questions...?"

"Hm? I was just confirming that the teacher and us live in different worlds. A client told me the other day. Kids these days use the term 'parent lottery', right? Well, you see, we simply don't have the means to send Meisa to university. Meisa must understand that, surely?"

　Speaking up in place of Uehara-san, who had swallowed her words under the force of the unyielding tone, I said:

"Families facing circumstances that make further education difficult can apply for 'Tuition Fee Reduction', which provides support for entrance fees and tuition. There's also a 'Grant-Type Scholarship' system, where repayment after graduation isn't required. Naturally, Meisa-san herself would need to maintain a certain grade point average."

"Scholarships, right? I know that much. But aren't they essentially loans?"

"As the name suggests, non-repayable grants do not require repayment. ...However, it's true that the selection process for non-repayable scholarships is rigorous. With only about one in ten applicants succeeding, it's a very narrow path. Realistically, you should consider taking out a loan-based scholarship. As you say, these do require repayment after graduation, but why not explore these options?"

　The look my mother gave me was one I'd often seen since childhood.
A look that said, 'Read the room'.

"I'm terribly sorry, sensei, that you came all this way. Our family isn't as well-off as yours, you see. We simply can't contemplate letting her dawdle about for four years. And Meisa? If you truly wish to study at university, why not show some resolve by borrowing the money yourself and repaying it yourself? Honestly, you're still the child who relies on her parents forever."

Mother shifted her gaze back to me and bowed her head.

"I must prepare for work now. Please take your leave."

The conversation was abruptly ended. This was likely the extent of what a single teacher could intervene in.

Raising children, continuing to raise them, bearing the financial burden – fundamentally, these are the parents' roles. As long as Uehara-san is a minor, there is, in principle, no substitute.

I straightened my back once more.

Precisely because of this, I have something I wish to convey to the parents.
