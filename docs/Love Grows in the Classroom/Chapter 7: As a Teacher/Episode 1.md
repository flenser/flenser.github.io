Episode One: Homeroom Teacher ―April 2033―

I love spring, yet I dislike it just as much.

Reason one: The drastic temperature swings between morning/evening and daytime trigger my allergies.

Reason two: March and April bring such drastic changes to my surroundings that I often feel exhausted by daily life.

Reason three: ...It reminds me of the pain of heartbreak.

　　　　　　　　　　◇

The calendar had turned to April.

This academic year, due to the aforementioned reason number two, I was utterly exhausted every day, though I strove never to show it as a working adult.

No transfer order came from Minami High School, so teaching at this school this year remained unchanged from last.

So, what had changed significantly, then?

"How do you feel about being a form tutor for the first time?"

After the study session ended and everyone had left the classroom, Uehara-san, who as usual stayed behind until last, cupped her hands around her mouth to mimic a microphone and addressed me.

Yes, starting this April, I had taken on the responsibility of being a form tutor for the first time.

"Well... the responsibility towards the pupils is greater, and there are many unfamiliar tasks, so it's challenging. But I intend to do my utmost to ensure each pupil can lead a fulfilling school life."

"Now, this isn't an interview, so you don't need to be so formal with me. Though, I suppose that's one of your good points."

Uehara-san said this, a gentle smile playing on her lips.

Having advanced to Year 3, she seemed more mature in her speech and demeanour than before. Even if she didn't seek it, her striking appearance – for better or worse – meant she was already recognised and popular among the new students, I often heard.

"But having you as form tutor? The kids in Class 2-1 are so lucky. Mine's got Hashimoto-san, of all people. She's way too strict!"

"They wouldn't entrust me with form tutoring for exam candidates at this stage. Hashimoto-sensei is a seasoned veteran – isn't that a good thing?"

"Eh? But this year, you're not teaching Language and Culture anymore, so we'll have less contact. That's sad."

"With the new teacher, Umeno-sensei, the lessons should be far more substantive than mine ever were."

"...That's not what I was talking about."

Perhaps displeased with my reply, Uehara-san turned her face away.

"I'd love to show the new first-years this side of you, Uehara-san—the one they admire as 'beautiful and mature'."

"The real me? I only show that to you, sensei."

　I’d meant to tease her, but ended up being teased myself, and fell silent. I realised how vulnerable I’d become lately to Uehara-san’s jibes.

I had to change the subject.

"...So you're finally in third year, Uehara-san. How's your exam prep going? Making steady progress?"

Even to my eye, she seemed to be studying more than before, but I still felt her focus was woefully lacking. After all, every single one of the brilliant students at this prestigious school, and the rare geniuses with extraordinary intellect, will become rivals.

"Yeah, it's fine. I'm doing it properly."

If Uehara-san says so, then I, who am neither her homeroom nor subject teacher, have no choice but to believe her.

When she expressed a desire to go to university, I did make a home visit and persuaded her mother, but ultimately whether she studies or not is up to Uehara-san herself. I feel it would be wrong to nag her too much.

　My top priority, the one I must keep an eye on, is the students of Class 2-1.

I must be careful not to become overly emotionally invested in Uehara-san alone.

　　　　　　　　　　◇

The mid-term exams in May had ended without incident, and it was around the time when whispers of 'May sickness' began circulating.

With university entrance exams still a distant prospect and the first-years only just beginning to settle into their new lives, there's scarcely a trace of tension among the pupils in my lessons. Well, perhaps it's just my classes.

Leaving the classroom after finishing my lesson with Class 2-1, my homeroom class, I let out a small sigh.

　Today, about seventy percent of the students had their minds elsewhere. While I value student autonomy in their approach to learning, classical studies involve teaching foundational grammar early in the first year. Stumbling here risks leaving them with a lingering sense of inadequacy for the rest of their studies.

Whether they choose to learn or not is their freedom, but the desire for them to find Japanese language interesting is something I've held since my student days when I aspired to become a Japanese teacher.

　Thanks to Hisako-san, I came to love classical literature, just as she did.

"...Kakei-san?"

I heard someone call my name as I walked down the corridor. Stopping and turning, I saw Ogata-san from Year 1, Class 2, who had just finished her lesson, standing there looking somewhat nervous.

"Yes, what is it, Ogata-san?"

"Um, I... well, there's something I didn't understand in class... Kakei-san, could you spare a moment after school today to explain it to me?"

There was no reason to refuse. In fact, I was rather touched.

Ogata-san hadn't seemed particularly attentive during the lesson, but to think she was motivated enough to come and ask questions herself.

"Of course. I'll wait in the staff room."

Just as I was reflecting on how blind I must be, Ogata-san became flustered.

"Ah, no! Well... I'd rather not be seen by others, so somewhere out of sight would be better..."

"Yes, understood. I'll be waiting in the second elective classroom in the west building."

She seemed the type of student who felt embarrassed about asking questions about things she didn't understand. Thinking that, I agreed without any particular suspicion.

"Ah, thank you very much! Well then, excuse me."

Relieved, Ogata-san relaxed his cheeks, bowed, and returned to the classroom.

　Ogata-san doesn't have the flashy impression of Uehara-san, but she always gives off a clean, tidy vibe and is the sort of student who keeps her belongings well organised.

She isn't the type to take the lead in livening up the class, but as her form teacher, my impression is that she's a kind-hearted student who quietly supports others.

And she's always with the same group of friends. I'd assumed that having made new close friends since starting high school must be making her school life enjoyable.
