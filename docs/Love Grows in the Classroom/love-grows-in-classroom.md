## Original Title

放課後の教室に、恋はつもる

## Description

"I'll say 'I like you' as many times as it takes. Until you respond."

"I like you, Sensei."

The female student before me confesses her feelings to me again today.

Her name is Uehara Meisa.

The only thing she and I had in common was our gender — our thoughts, personalities, ages, and positions were all different.

"How many times must I tell you I cannot return your feelings before you understand?"

"Until you accept them."

My second year as a teacher, filled with nothing but the unimaginable.

After school in the classroom, once again today, I am being cornered by her.
