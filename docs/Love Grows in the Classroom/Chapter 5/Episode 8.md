Episode Eight: Confession ―September 2032―

The teacher who'd been worried about me offered to drive me home.

"Please get in. Have you fastened your seatbelt?"

"Yes, I'm fine. Thank you, teacher. I'll leave it to you."

The car, with no music playing, started moving, creating a space just for me and the teacher.

The car interior had a strangely nostalgic smell, naturally bringing back memories of that summer night. It seems true that scent and memory are directly linked.

"...So, how did you know I was in trouble, sensei? The power of love?"

I asked teasingly, and she gave a soft chuckle.

"Not me, I think it was the power of Sasaki-san's love."

"Eh? Why Ryōka?"

"Sasaki-san came to the staff room. She asked if I knew anything about Uehara-san acting strangely since she got back together with Kinugasa-kun."

...I was stunned. So that was why Suzuka hadn't gone straight home after school – she'd gone to see the teacher.

"I didn't have any specific suspicions, but I thought... if Kinugasa-kun knew about my interactions with Uehara-san outside school, she might be dating him because he was threatening our relationship. ... I thought Uehara-san was a student who rather looked up to me, so if she couldn't speak to me for nearly two weeks, I'd at least feel something was off."

"...So, teacher, you were wondering why I hadn't been talking to you lately?"

"...Well, yes. So it's only natural to wonder if something happened."

The car interior was dark, and the teacher was driving. I smirked broadly, confident I wouldn't be noticed.

"Sasaki-san used a location-sharing app to confirm Uehara-san was at the family restaurant in Ōmiya. After leaving school to look for Uehara-san, Sasaki-san kept me updated, so I was able to pinpoint your location smoothly."

"Eh⁉ So you exchanged contact details with Suzuka, Sensei⁉"

"Yes. I know it's not ideal as a teacher, but it was an emergency."

"That's not the point! You turned me down first! I only got your number after all that! It's not fair!"

Seeing me pout, the teacher spoke soothingly.

"Don't sulk. Thanks to Sasaki-san, we were able to help Uehara-san."

Glancing at my phone, I saw a message from Suzuka had arrived.

'I heard the situation from Kakei-sensei. Take it easy today."

...I resolved to properly apologise and talk things through with my best friend later, for worrying her.

Ryōka had sensed my feelings for the teacher for ages. That's why I think she gave me time to face her. If not, she would have barged in herself the moment she sensed the trouble with Wataru.

"...Teacher, your hair's all messy."

"I ran at full speed for the first time in ages. I really ought to exercise more often."

The sweat seemed to have dried already, but seeing her usually perfectly tied-back black hair dishevelled made me happy. I wouldn't say it out loud as it would be rude, but I couldn't stop my cheeks from softening.

"Did you push yourself for my sake, Sensei?"

"It was a matter of great importance for one of my pupils."

"...Truly, thank you, Sensei. I'm fine now."

　Perhaps because I’d already made up my mind.

Though my heart pounded loudly and my throat felt parched, the words slipped out quite naturally.

"Sensei. I think I understand what it means to be in love."

Sensei’s eyes seemed to widen just a little.

"Is that so? Congratulations."

The car stopped at the red light. At the quiet T-junction, time seemed to stand still.

Did this person have no inkling that I was about to confess?

That seemingly oblivious insensitivity, that lack of passion that made it seem like she wouldn't care who I liked, that utter indifference to her own charm – all of it, all of it...

"I like you. I really like you, Sensei."
