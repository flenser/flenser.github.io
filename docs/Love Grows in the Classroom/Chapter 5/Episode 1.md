Episode One: It's Not Unrelated, Is It? —August 2032—

The longest summer holiday of my life had come to an end.

Though regular lessons for the second term started today, a lingering holiday atmosphere still hung over the class.

People with sun-kissed skin, dyed hair, new girlfriends, or those who'd studied hard and gained confidence, everyone seemed to have undergone some sort of change...

　But honestly, I couldn't be bothered focusing on everyone else. I'd had quite a significant change myself this summer.

I looked out the window. The weather was overcast. Part of me regretted that there was no Language and Culture class today.

Lately, I couldn't get into my studies. Meaningless sighs had increased. Even when hanging out with friends, I couldn't get into the spirit of things. ...It was all the teacher's fault.

　There's no point pretending anymore. Inside me, Kakei Rio – that plain, serious, boring Japanese teacher – is becoming quite a significant presence.

Ever since that summer night I stayed at the teacher's house, things have been strange.

Emotions I never knew I had seem to be taking shape, regardless of my will, and it unsettles me.

The more time I spent thinking about the teacher, the more I felt I was losing myself, and it frightened me.

　I'd only just confessed how scared I was to fall for someone, yet now I'm agonising over how much I care about the very person I told. To her, this must seem utterly baffling behaviour.

Why do I want to touch her? ...Why do I want her to touch me?

No, I'm just deliberately beating about the bush. I know the answer deep down. But I'm turning away from my own feelings, afraid I shouldn't realise it.

　Because if I admitted it, I, I wouldn't be able to stop myself.

　　　　　　　　　　☆

While I was lost in thought, the fourth period ended and it was lunchtime.

On my way to the courtyard with Suzuka, I spotted someone dressed simply and plainly, walking with an unusually good posture.

The person I hadn't had a chance to speak to since that day I stayed over. The person I'd only glimpsed at yesterday's opening ceremony, never catching a proper look at their face.

The moment I saw the back of Kakei-san, currently the solo lead at number one in my 'People I Want to See and Talk to Even If I Have No Reason' ranking, my cheeks relaxed and I couldn't hold back.

"Sensei♡"

I ran up, peered into his face, and spoke. His large, pale irises turned towards me. That alone sent my excitement soaring.

"Good afternoon, Uehara-san."

"Eh? Why so formal all of a sudden?"

"I don't mean to be. It takes time to shake off that summer holiday feeling, but let's stay focused for the second term."

She still only ever says such stiff things, yet somehow it makes me happy.

"Ah. You must come eat at Palm again too, Sensei♡"

"Well now. It was delicious, so I'd like to visit again, but I feel a bit awkward going while students are working. I'll come when you're not here, Uehara-san."

"Why? That defeats the whole point, doesn't it?"

As I laughed and gave the teacher a light pat on the back, Suzuka tilted her head slightly.

"Meisa and Kakei-sensei... were you two ever that close?"

"Well, yes. It wouldn't be an exaggeration to call it a special relationship."

"That's an exaggeration."

"How rude. Oh well. See you, Sensei."

"Yes."

Ryōka and I walked back towards the courtyard as if nothing had happened. As if talking to Sensei was just another ordinary event.

And yet, as I sat down on a courtyard bench to eat my melon bread, Ryōka dropped a bombshell.

"Meisa, you really fancy Kakei-san, don't you?"

"Eh? Why⁉"

"Well, you were obviously in a much better mood. You looked happy."

Being pointed out like this, so innocently, was incredibly embarrassing.

...What name would an outsider give to my feelings for the teacher? ...I wanted an objective opinion.

　And this time, that person couldn't be the teacher.

I stole a glance sideways at Suzuka. Trying to appear as natural as possible, I steered the conversation towards my best friend, who was opening her small lunchbox.

"Wh-whatever, totally changing the subject here! Lately, you know... there's someone I've been... just a little bit... interested in."

Even so, perhaps because it was an inevitably nerve-wracking topic for me, my voice cracked and sounded anything but natural. ...Had Ryōka noticed?

"I wanted to overreact dramatically, but sorry. I think I know who you're interested in, Meisa."

"Eh⁉ No way⁉"

Looking up in shock, I saw Ryōka staring intently into my eyes, a smile playing on her lips.

"Shall I repeat what I just said? Meisa, you like Kakei-san, don't you?"

The question, more direct than I could have imagined, pierced my heart.

I was lost for words. Ryōka's apparent bluntness might have been my own misjudgement. I sensed she understood far more than I'd imagined.

　Rather than innocent curiosity, I sensed a hint of mischief from her – like she already knew the answer but was deliberately tilting her head.

I didn't want to dig myself into a hole with a clumsy remark, nor did I want her to expose feelings I hadn't fully reconciled within myself yet.

"No, no! She's seven years older than me! She's a school teacher! And... she's a woman?"

"Why are you trying to dodge the question? You're definitely interested, right? And I was sure of it from the way Meisa looks at Kakei-sensei, and how her whole demeanour softens."

"Eh? That's just your own assumptions and delusions, isn't it?"

"Actually, there's something I've always wondered about, why is it always assumed Meisa's romantic interests are male? If you like someone, shouldn't it not matter whether they're a man or a woman?"

　I blinked in surprise. It was such an unexpected thing to hear from Ryōka.

"I always thought Ryōka disliked that sort of thing, or had some sort of prejudice..."

Ryōka was known by everyone, herself included, to be a sucker for handsome guys. She was currently in a mutual love with her boyfriend Fuwa, and back in middle school she'd dated boys normally.

"Not at all, I'm the type who thinks, 'If they're happy with it, isn't that fine?' Well, I'll never see women as romantic partners myself, though."

"Oh... I see..."

Apparently, I was the one who'd been making assumptions about Ryōka. I really need to reflect on that.

"But same-sex relationships must be tough, what with the legal restrictions. I reckon you'd have to be really into the other person for it to last."

　Hearing that, I found myself unconsciously picturing my teacher. Could I truly possess that feeling of 'liking' someone above all else?

My gaze drifted down to the melon bread I was eating.

Couples like Ryōka and Fuwa are admired by everyone.

They're good-looking, and you can really tell they adore each other. Just watching them makes you happy.

　They go on dates together, take photos, and post about where they went, what they did, and how they felt on social media. They're just an ordinary high school couple who can hold hands in public without anyone giving them strange looks – in fact, they get smiled at.

Compared to Suzuka, who enjoys that ordinary happiness as if it were natural, I feel less admiration than envy.

　I want to experience a love that's just sweet too.

I want a romance I can talk about with others, something I can boast about.

But. If love is about being drawn to someone so intensely that reason can't control it...

Then until I can accept that part of myself, I don't want anyone interfering.

Having made that one big resolution, I finally managed to look back into Ryōka's eyes properly.

"Listen, Suzuka. I know it feels like I was the one who wanted to talk to you, but could you just wait a little while?"

"Yeah, I understand. Whenever you feel like talking, just let me know."

Her straightforward reply proved Suzuka's stance was neutral, and that alone made me trust her.

I still had no idea where this feeling would lead, but I decided that if anything happened, I would properly tell Suzuka.
