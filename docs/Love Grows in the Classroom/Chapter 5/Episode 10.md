Episode Ten: Fall for Me. ―October 2032―

"Why does '-tari' here mean 'continuing'?"

"Read the sentence through to the end. When '-tari' can be translated as '-ing', it indicates continuation, not completion."

In the empty second-floor classroom after school, I was having lessons with my teacher.

　The days I was scheduled for extra lessons used to be so dreary, yet now I’m the kind of diligent pupil who seeks out the teacher to ask about things I didn’t understand in class.

...Which is a lie. Studying is merely an excuse. I just want to see the teacher.

　A month had passed since then. Even when October arrived and it was time to wear blazers, Wataru hadn't shown anyone that photo he kept on his phone, nor had he spread rumours about me and the teacher.

Despite saying he wouldn't support me, Wataru, true to his usual sincere self, gave me a push from behind. That's why I could meet the teacher today, too, standing tall as a student.

"You really ought to dress more stylishly, sensei. It's a shame with such good material."

"I have neither fashion sense nor interest in it. Didn't Stephen Joseph's signature look come from always wearing the same outfit?"

"But your clothes feel... mass-produced, you know? Lacking individuality."

"...That's too difficult. I doubt I could ever grasp the difference."

The switched-off tablet on the desk and this trivial conversation. The situation mirrored that tutoring session which had brought us closer.

　The teacher-student dynamic, the age gap – those things hadn't changed either, obviously.

The only thing that had changed was how I felt about my teacher.

"Hey, Sensei. Let's go on a date sometime. I'll pick out your clothes for you ♡"

"You never learn, do you? As long as you're my student and I'm your teacher, our relationship won't change."

"How can you be so sure? Don't you think we'd have to try to find out?"

The teacher sighed audibly, loud enough for me to hear.

"Until quite recently, you were so timid about liking people. Love really does change a person, doesn't it?"

"Which means you changed me, teacher."

Every day, I want to tell the teacher I like her. I want her to like me back soon.

　Every time we're alone, I tell her how I feel. I reckon she must be starting to fancy kissing me or something by now. But every day, she just calmly refuses me, like it's routine paperwork.

The teacher who taught me what it means to love is now trying to erase my first love with an irresponsibility unbecoming of a teacher.

Our opinions remain at odds, yet our gazes meet.

　Ah, if only gazing like this could make someone fall for me.

"...Uehara-san. I..."

Just as the teacher's lips parted slightly, the familiar, mechanical chime sounded.

Suddenly pulled back into reality, I felt an overwhelming ache at the sight of the teacher's silhouette in the sunset-drenched classroom.

"Sensei, just now..."

"...Is it that time already? It's time for pupils to go home. Until tomorrow."

"Ah, yes. See you tomorrow, Sensei."

Saying this as if nothing had happened, the teacher swiftly left the classroom, just as she had when the lesson ended.

Though disappointed that an external factor like the bell had interrupted us, I couldn't hide the greater joy that made my cheeks relax.

"...Tomorrow, she said."

Doesn't she realise? There's no lesson for our class tomorrow. Which means she thinks I'll come see her after school again tomorrow, right?

I want to say, "You're being overly confident," but I'll hold back, teasing her might just make her guard go up again. Besides, I fully intend to go see her.

　I touched my cheeks, still warm from her touch, and let out a small sigh.

Her feelings are her own, but still, selfish me just can't help wishing.

Hey, Sensei. Please fall for me.
