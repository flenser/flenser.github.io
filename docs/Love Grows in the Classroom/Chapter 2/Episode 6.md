Episode Six: Rio Kakei: Past Story 3 ―March 2025―

I'd never really spoken to my classmates before, but if there was business to discuss, we'd exchange a few words. Now, however, even the most essential matters and necessary communications were ignored as if I didn't exist at all.

　Rumours about me were being spread among the students, and apparently I’d been cast as this gloomy, lying, despicable person who felt no qualms about deceiving others. …Well, the gloomy part might be accurate.

The ringleader, Shirogasaki-san, seemed utterly unfazed, as if she knew I’d never ask anyone for help. She even played the victim.

It baffled me completely. She'd congratulated me on getting top marks in the year, praised my hard work – so why was she doing this?

I've always been unable to discern what others truly think, to read their minds. If this hasn't changed even in high school, it probably won't change as I grow older, or even at the moment of death.

Thinking about the conflicts with others born from the repeated misunderstandings of the past, and those that would surely repeat in the future, weighed heavily on me.

　Well, this sort of harassment isn't new to me either; I'm used to it. Perhaps it's nothing to get worked up about.

...That's what I was thinking, until one particular day.

"Ah, Kakei-san."

On a day when my duty meant I was leaving later than usual, I bumped into Shirogasaki-san at the entrance. Most students who weren't in clubs had already left, and those with clubs were all still practising. A strange silence hung between us.

"I missed asking you the other day, but how much did you study for the finals? Did you burn the midnight oil or anything?"

"...I studied a bit more than last term, but it was normal."

"...Oh, really? Getting results with just a bit of studying is really impressive."

"I didn't say I only studied a little."

"Really? Even though you're top of the year? ...Hey, did you get first place in Language and Culture too?"

"Yeah."

—At that moment, I saw the corner of Shirogasaki-san's mouth lift.

"Ah, that explains it. Kakei-san, you're favoured by Hisako-san, aren't you? Did she perhaps tell you what would be on the test?"

I couldn't help but object to such a remark that insulted Hisako-san's dignity.

"Hisako-san would never do such a thing. Besides, I'm not favoured."

　To her, I'm just one of many students. ...It was merely a re-affirmation of the most obvious fact, yet somehow my chest pricked with pain.

"Really? But Hisako-san eats lunch with Kakei-san, doesn't she?"

"I think that's just Hisako-san feeling sorry for me having no friends – it's an act born of her sense of duty as a teacher and sympathy."

"Can Kakei-san read Hisako-san's mind? You can't, can you? Then I don't think you can make such a definitive statement."

"...I can't read it, but neither can you, Shirogasaki-san."

"True. Well, if Kakei-san's Japanese grades stay top of the year even after Hisako-san stops teaching next year, I'll admit there was no favouritism."

　Neither of us had anything to prove our claims, so I couldn't argue back any further. That's why I let Shirogasaki-san get away with her absurd argument.

"Fine. From now until graduation, I'll be number one."

"Oh? I'll be looking forward to it."

Watching Shirogasaki-san's smiling back as she walked away, I couldn't move for a while. Somehow, my body felt heavy. Living is tiring. I thought that vaguely.

　But I couldn't get home without walking. As I trudged home with heavy steps, a car approached and rolled down its window. I avoided looking at the car because I was scared, but

"Rio."

It was Hisako-san's voice, so I relaxed. When I bowed my head to greet her, she looked unusually serious.

"Why are you trudging along like that... What's wrong?"

"I'm not trudging along. I'm just more tired than usual today."

"...I'm sorry if I'm wrong. Are you perhaps being bullied in class right now?"

I had absolutely no confidence I could fool Hisako-san.

"Yes, a little. I'm not really bothered about it, and I won't go into details."

　It wasn't because I feared Shirogasaki-san's resentment; it was more that it all felt like too much hassle. It was probably just a passing phase anyway, and with the class reshuffle coming soon, I wanted to keep things peaceful.

"Right... well then, get in."

"Eh?"

"Get in the passenger seat. Let's go for a drive, Rio."

Hisako-san opened the door and practically forced me into the car.
