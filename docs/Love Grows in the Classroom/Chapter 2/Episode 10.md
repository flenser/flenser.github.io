Episode Ten: The Run-Up to Farewell ―December 2032―

"...Well, someone has been showing me affection..."

"You mean... a student, perhaps?"

Having just mustered the courage to speak, I was swiftly rendered speechless. My foolish reaction seemed to confirm Hisako-san's suspicions, for she smirked, the corners of her mouth lifting.

"...Good grief. How did you know?"

"Didn't I tell you? How long do you think we've known each other? Besides, given how limited your social circle is, Rio, it stands to reason a student or colleague would be the most likely candidate."

Terrifying deductive skills. Or perhaps the problem is that my social circle is simply too small?

　Well, for better or worse, there was no need to beat about the bush anymore. Feeling a little less tense, I resumed the conversation.

"...Um, a student confessed to me... Of course, I turned them down. It's unthinkable for a teacher and student to date."

"Hmm hmm. The episode itself seems to be over, yet you're still troubled. So it's not about whether to date or not, is it?"

"Yes. But... even though I shouldn't be thinking about dating anyone 'right now', I find myself caring about this student more than the others. And... w-well, even if we did start dating after they turned eighteen, I can't believe someone like me has the ability to make anyone happy..."

Could Uehara-san really be happy dating someone like me, who lacks any self-confidence? After graduation, the magical illusion that only existed during high school might fade, and they might forget all about me.

　If that's how it is, then so be it. ...If only I could say that with conviction. But standing before Hisako-san, I revert to being just a student, childishly listing only my own desires.

"I-I wonder if I'm failing as a teacher, carrying these feelings while interacting with them...?"

Hisako-san's eyes widened, but she said nothing. I took a sip of coffee, trying to calm my still-pounding heart.

　...Or rather. Had I said something so shameful that it made her recoil like that?

"...P-please say something..."

"Sorry, sorry! I was just a bit startled... But still, Rio? That you're thinking about it so seriously means that child is very important to you, isn't it?"

Lifting my face at the sound of Hisako-san's gentle, soft voice, I saw the smile of the teacher I liked.

"...Yes, that's right. Yes."

So I could honestly affirm it. Originally, if asked "Do you like that girl?", I'd have answered "No". But when asked "She's important to you, isn't she?", I could only answer "Yes".

"Rio. I'm truly delighted that you're weaving your own unique story. Don't worry, whatever choice you make, whatever ending it brings, it will undoubtedly be something to be proud of."

After saying this, Hisako-san happily sipped her rooibos tea, then added,

"Ah, but still... for that boy to have taken a liking to you, Rio. He has quite an eye for talent, despite his youth. His heart must be handsome too, I'm sure."

"Heart 'too'... are you assuming he's handsome too?"

"Yes! Definitely handsome! My guess is an actor..."

The actor Hisako-san happily speculated about and Uehara-san, of course, bore no resemblance whatsoever. The teacher must be utterly convinced that I was confessed to by a male student.

　Because the idea that someone like me or Uehara-san could be attracted to someone of the same sex is simply beyond her comprehension.

"Well? Did I get it right?"

"Not even close."

"No way! Tell me who they look like!"

"Well... I'm not really familiar with celebrities myself, but apparently the students say I look like Nanaka from 'BE YOU'."

"So that means you're incredibly beautiful⁉ ...You're far more handsome than I ever imagined...!"

Listening to Hisako-san's wild imaginings and laughing along, within me, preparations for departure slowly fell into place.

Hisako-san, who gave me the running start I needed to say goodbye, was truly a wonderful teacher.

"Right then, Rio. I'll be in touch."

"Yes. Do take care of yourself, sensei. Oh, and let me know when you find out the gender. Given my personality, I'll probably agonise over what to get you as a baby gift."

"Hehe, the due date is still over five months away, you know? But thank you, Rio. I'll let you know as soon as I find out."

After seeing Hisako-san to her front door, I drove home, reflecting on the day.

We talked about many things afterwards, but she didn't offer any particularly specific advice, nor did I ask for guidance or direction for the future.

　With her circumstances about to change dramatically and our interactions likely to diminish, Hisako-sensei was probably trying to shift my current state of dependence on her. I think I've finally managed to break free from that reliance on her.

Now independent, I was thinking for myself about what I wanted to do going forward.
