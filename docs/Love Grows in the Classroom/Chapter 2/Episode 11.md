Episode Eleven: Please Don't Go —December 2032—

The end-of-term ceremony for the second term was on the 23rd of December.

"Winter break starts tomorrow, doesn't it? I thought this during summer break too, but when you have someone you like at school, the holidays feel ridiculously long, which I really hate."

Uehara-san came to the second elective classroom after the ceremony as if it were only natural. Having anticipated this and waited for her, I found myself feeling a mixture of delight and embarrassment that my prediction had been correct.

　I took a breath, silently justifying to myself that it wasn't for some unprofessional teacherly reason like wanting to see her face before the long break.

There was something I absolutely had to tell Uehara-san today.

"...Um, Uehara-san."

The usual me would have given any other student a bland, non-committal warning like, "Please don't get too carried away over the winter holidays."

　But my mind was entirely occupied with tomorrow, and the very reason I felt I had to see her today stemmed from that.

"What is it, sensei?"

I only needed to say that one word, yet my fingertips and lips trembled slightly from the tension. It was because the words I was about to utter were not those of a teacher.

"Tomorrow, Christmas Eve... Please don't go to your part-time job."

　Uehara-san blinked. It was hardly surprising she was startled by such a sudden, selfish request.

"Eh? Why?"

"The reason is, well, how should I put it..."

I had already prepared excuses I could use as a teacher.

"It's against school rules," "I can't overlook working at a bar serving alcohol," "It's dangerous," – various patterns flashed through my mind.

　But she knew that words from a teacher wouldn't stop Uehara-san.

After pondering what to do, the answer was:

"Because I don't want you to go, Uehara-san."

It was simply conveying her own feelings honestly.

It held no coercive power. It was a feeble measure, little more than hoping Uehara-san would listen.

"...Listen, sensei..."

I was fully aware I was making a terrible request as an adult. What must Uehara-san have thought of me? Only now did the fear creep in that she might be utterly disillusioned.

"...You know how much people hate it when you tell them you can't come the day before your shift, right? You're an adult too, sensei."

Uehara-san seemed exasperated, turning her face away from me as she spoke flatly.

"W-well... if you say you won't go, Uehara-san, I'll contact your mother and the shop myself!"

"No, that's not the issue... Haa. Actually... I still can cancel it."

...So she was disappointed after all. But if Uehara-san said she wouldn't go to work... wait,

"Uuugh... No way! Impossible! I can't stop grinning!"

　Contrary to my expectations, Uehara-san threw her arms around me with a goofy grin I'd never seen before.

"U-Uehara-san⁉ This is school, you know? What if someone sees us⁉"

"Who cares? Are you sure you're alright with this, Sensei? If I have to hold back my happiness energy right here and now, I might just explode later, you know?"

"What sort of incomprehensible threat is that..."

Even saying that, I couldn't push Uehara-san away.

It was a calculated response: gratitude towards her for accepting my feelings, and the fact that only the brass band members would likely be heading to the west building after the closing ceremony.

　...Why am I so overly logical? If Uehara-san could hear my inner thoughts right now, she'd definitely find me utterly creepy.

All I need to do is tell her, "That's good."

Yet something so simple feels impossibly difficult for me.

"Hey, Sensei. I realise you might be busy or have plans... but if you don't have anything scheduled... could we... spend tomorrow together?"

"Y-yes. Well... let's spend time together."

"Really⁉ Yes! Wow, what do I do... I'm so happy..."

Uehara-san's embrace tightened around me.

I could never possibly hug her back, but just this once... I decided to hold my tongue to avoid any tactless remarks.
