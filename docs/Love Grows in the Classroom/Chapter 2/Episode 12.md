Episode Twelve: Christmas Party ―December 2032―

The town was aglow with festive lights, and shops buzzed with sales and fairs. Yet here I was, alone at home, feeling more restless than ever.

Then, at three o'clock, the intercom rang. At a time when I'd normally be reading or surfing the net on a holiday, I sat bolt upright.

　I confirmed today's visitor had arrived via the monitor. ...Blimey, it felt unreal. My heart was beating as fast as a small child's.

Unlocking the door and opening it, today's visitor, Uehara-san, flashed a bright smile.

"Merry Christmas, Sensei ♡"

The moment I saw Uehara-san, I felt an embarrassing surge of "How cute!" mixed with a guilt-like emotion at the situation of a student in casual clothes coming to my house. I ended up responding rather curtly.

"Please try not to call me 'Sensei' at the front door. I might get reported."

"Oh, come on, that's cold. Right then, I'll just come in."

This wasn't the first time Uehara-san had come to my house. That day during the summer holidays, circumstances aside... I had let her stay over.

But that was an absolute exception. Today, however, I had made prior arrangements to invite a student to my house. This was undoubtedly an action taken by my own volition.

In other words, there was no way to wriggle out of it.

"You're far too cautious, Sensei. I wouldn't have minded meeting outside. Well, being alone together at home does get the adrenaline pumping, so it's fine."

"Meeting outside on a day like today is far too risky... If we were spotted by anyone connected to the school, it would be disastrous."

Even if it were someone of the same sex, even if we claimed it was just a chance encounter outside, you never know how people would interpret it or what they might say.

　Especially today, Christmas Eve, a day that holds a little extra significance for the world. I shouldn't have taken even the slightest risk... Juggling yesterday's decision and today's guilt, I finally approached the holy night.

"Even if someone saw us, I wouldn't mind if they thought we were lovers?"

Uehara-san entered the living room and took off her coat, so I took it and hung it up. The white high-neck knit dress she wore suited her perfectly, but its short length revealed the whiteness and slenderness of her thighs, making me avert my gaze involuntarily.

Even her uniform skirt shows this much, yet perhaps because it's casual wear, or because we're alone in the house, I found myself oddly conscious of it.

"Even if you yourself think it's fine, others might not approve, so it's a problem..."

She pressed a finger to my lips.

"I've been looking forward to this since yesterday. Don't you, Sensei?"

I swallowed hard. ...It was only natural she looked sad. What on earth was I doing?

It was utterly rude of me to invite her over, take up her time, and then sit here brooding like this.

"...I've been having a wonderful time, both yesterday and now. Um, Uehara-san..."

First, I'd convey my true feelings to her – disguised as mere courtesy – for dressing up just to come to my place.

"Your outfit today is absolutely lovely."

"Really? Yay! I was a bit worried it might be a bit much, but it's a home date, so I went all out."

"Thank you. It suits you very well."

The corners of Uehara-san's eyes softened.

"You always say exactly what I want to hear at times like this, don't you?"

"What do you mean?"

"I worked hard because I wanted to be told I looked cute, so I'm happy!"

At last, Uehara-san's expression brightened, and I felt relieved.

Our Christmas party had begun.

"Right then, let's get the party preparations underway. Though really, it's just a case of taking the food out of the fridge and arranging it on the table."

I'd promised to provide the cake, various other foods, and drinks. That said, with my non-existent home cooking skills, there was no way I could whip up party-worthy delicacies. As a working adult, I'd opted to solve it with money and had informed Uehara-san of this beforehand.

"Wow, amazing! Looks absolutely delicious! Though... it looks rather expensive!"

"Being an adult, I decided to splash out a bit here."

A roast chicken far too large for just the two of us, and hors d'oeuvres in quantities that took over the table. For Christmas cake, I'd prepared two types: a shortcake and a Bûche de Noël.

"Eh⁉ Thank you, Sensei! Can I take a photo? Or rather, can I post it on SNS? But maybe that's a bit like hinting at something, so maybe not?"

Not understanding the meaning of 'hinting', I just nodded along. But watching Uehara-san, acting her age, excitedly taking photos with her smartphone camera, a warmth spread through my chest and my cheeks relaxed naturally.

Then, finally, it hit me. My home, where I rarely cook, possesses no stylish plates. I even use paper plates to minimise washing up.

Even today, however delicious the food might be, it would be served on paper plates. If she were to take photos to keep or post on social media, paper plates would surely embarrass Uehara-san.

...I should have prepared some. After all, following 'that incident', it got swept under the carpet, but I should have gone shopping with Uehara-san.

"However splendid the meal, my home lacks stylish plates... so, you know, it won't be very 'Instagrammable', will it?"

Uehara-san blinked, then laughed brightly, her cheerfulness blowing away any trace of my worry.

"Ahaha! 'Instagrammable', that word suits you so poorly, Sensei!"

"P-please don't laugh so much. ...I'm using it correctly, right?"

"It is, but honestly, you shouldn't worry about that at all! I'm just happy to be spending Christmas with you."

"But spending time with you was only decided yesterday, so I couldn't get one of those famous patissier cakes that require reservations..."

"No, no, it's more than enough! Oh, don't bring out the cake yet, let's save it for after dinner! I'll pop it back in the fridge. Mind if I open it?"

　Unable to handle the sudden ball of kindness thrown my way, I blurted out an excuse, like I was hiding my embarrassment. Uehara-san, however, kept smiling happily the whole time.

She really is such a good girl, I thought honestly.

"Go ahead, use it however you like."

"Okay... Whoa, it's still completely empty! This is such a déjà vu from the summer holidays, it's hilarious!"

　Uehara-san's laughter echoed through my usually quiet, solitary room, lifting my spirits.

I simply watched, filled with admiration and longing, as her presence seemed to change the very colour of the air.

"Right, we're ready. So, Professor..."

I met Uehara-san's gaze as she took the lead, and we exchanged smiles.

"Merry Christmas!"

I raised champagne, Uehara-san ginger ale, and our Christmas party began.

Held in my small flat, it was a modest Christmas party. We really didn't do anything special.

In a room without a tree, we simply ate Christmas-themed food while chatting about trivial things.

For seventeen-year-old Uehara-san, it might have been boring.

But for me—

"Ryōka's travelling with Fuwa today and tomorrow."

"Eh? How do you get your parents' permission for trips with someone of the opposite sex? Is it just the times changing?"

"Ryōka's situation might be quite unusual. They're officially recognised by the family, those two."

"Is that so? That's amazing... My parents would never consider it."

"But you said your first love is someone you've always liked? ...Do you still like them?"

Was it the alcohol? Or perhaps the Christmas atmosphere?

My love, which I'd never told anyone... I couldn't tell her everything, but I felt I could tell Uehara-san.

"No. We're good friends now. But the fact that they're someone I've always cherished hasn't changed, and never will."

"...Someone you've always cherished, huh..."

"I-I'm sorry. Did I make you uncomfortable?"

Uehara-san, who had been staring intently at me as I panicked, thinking I'd made another thoughtless remark, suddenly smiled.

"No, of course I feel a bit jealous... but I also feel a little happy. You really are incredibly devoted once you fall for someone, aren't you? I think it's really wonderful."

　Those words shone like light into my twisted heart. I couldn't help but avert my gaze, unable to look directly at her.

My instincts kicked in, warning me that continuing this conversation was somehow 'dangerous'.

"Hey, Sensei. Look at me."

Could Uehara-san read my mind? Hesitantly, I lifted my face. There she was, smiling – always too dazzling for me.

"So, I'm the first person you've ever shared Christmas Eve cake and chicken with, right?"

"Yes, I suppose so. Well... excluding family, anyway."

"Hehe, yes!"

Seeing Uehara-san's face, genuinely happy if not conceited, something indescribable welled up deep within my chest.

I'd never been able to join in the other girls' talk of romance, never felt that fluttering in my chest for a boy like they described.

　Even after realising my feelings for Hisako-san, I could never confess them, keeping them locked away inside.

I never imagined that someone like me, who could never be proactive about romance, would spend such a blissful Christmas.

"Sensei? What's wrong? You seem lost in thought."

"...No, it's nothing. Please, help yourself to more."

Still, I had no intention of taking things further with Uehara-san. Even though I was so happy, there were things beyond my control, and I felt a pang of sadness at the same time.

That's precisely why I resolved to never forget this day for the rest of my life.

"I don't use social media, but I'll take a photo too."

"Why now⁉ It's all half-eaten now⁉"

Despite Uehara-san's teasing, I succeeded in preserving the memory within the small device.
