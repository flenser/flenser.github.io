Episode Two: Hisako-san — December 2032 —

Was my response back then truly the right one? Can I really approve of Uehara-san going to that part-time job?

What if some drunk bloke starts getting weird with her? What if he touches her against her will, even when she says no?

　Every time I picture Uehara-san like that, a storm rages within me. A thick, black emotion overflows, and I become furious beyond measure at the imaginary man.

I want to believe it is absolutely not romantic feelings. As an adult, as a teacher, I am simply deeply worried about a child who is also my pupil.

"Kakei-san, it's unusual to see you so lost in thought. Are you feeling unwell?" The one who had voiced concern was Masuda-san, who had been looking out for me ever since she joined the school as a new graduate last year.

A gentle-mannered woman due to retire the year after next, she teaches Japanese like me and shares a desk next to mine, making her the colleague I speak to most often.

...Or rather, I couldn't believe I'd been spacing out in the staff room. It was pathetic, especially since I'd only just pointed out Uehara-san's lack of concentration the other day.

"N-no! I-I'm sorry, I was just lost in thought."

"I'm glad you're not feeling unwell. You tend to be a bit too serious, Kakei-sensei. Try to take the occasional breather while you work."

"Y-yes..."

I felt genuinely apologetic. Allowing it to affect my work was something a professional should absolutely never do.

　No, perhaps it's precisely this line of thinking that would be criticised as 'too serious'? When my mind is completely preoccupied with worry for a student, when it threatens to spill over beyond the scope of my duties... what exactly would Hisako-san do in such a situation?

I want to talk to her. It's precisely because I keep remembering Hisako-san's presence in these mundane, everyday moments that I realise I must be dependent on her after all.

　I glanced at the desk calendar. Though I hadn't marked it with a circle or written any notes, next Saturday is a special day for me.

I'll share what's in my heart then. On the day I meet Hisako-san.

　　　　　　　　　　◇

Hisako Jinnai-san was my homeroom teacher during my first year of high school, and I can say without hesitation she had the greatest influence on my life.

　She made me realise my career path, my job prospects, and, that my romantic inclinations lay with people of the same sex.

It was twelve o'clock. The meeting place was a café with a calm atmosphere.

Until Hisako-san got married this year, we usually met in the evening, somewhere we could have drinks. Her contact had been about once a month for the last two years or so, but this time it had been four months.

　It felt so distant to me I couldn't even imagine it, but this must be what it means to marry and share your life with someone.

I did feel a sense of loneliness, but my own feelings were no reason not to celebrate her marriage and happiness. I'd accepted it as inevitable and moved on.

I considered it rude to keep Hisako-san waiting, so I'd never been late for a meeting with her.

　Today, as we were meeting at a café, I took a seat first and waited.

"Rio!"

It was a reflex ingrained over eight years. Just hearing that voice made my ears perk up, and simultaneously, I could spot Hisako-san immediately. Bowing my head, I was aware my heart was pounding like a drum.

"Hisako-san, it's been a long time."

"Have you been well? You seem rather grown-up now, haven't you?"

Sitting opposite me with a radiant smile, she appeared, perhaps due to her oversized jumper, and forgive me for saying so, a little plumper.

I surmised her newlywed life must be going splendidly. Ms. Hishako adores cooking, and her husband must be happily plump too.

"I'm past the age where people say I look grown-up. Besides, it's only been four months since we last met, it was summer."

Four months. Before, even a week without seeing her face or exchanging messages would make me feel lonely. The fact that my sense of time has dulled, perhaps Hisako-san is right, I really have grown up.

"I'd love for you to come to the wedding, Rio. Is it really too difficult?"

"Yes, I did want to go, but with it being overseas next autumn... I want to focus all my energy on preparing the students facing their exams. I'm terribly sorry."

There were two reasons, a mix of truth and politeness, for returning the invitation Hisako-san sent me marked 'declined'.

One was that I wasn't confident I could manage a genuine smile if I saw her wedding dress.

　And the other was that I wanted to be right there supporting Uehara-san, who was facing her entrance exams.

"No, it's fine. I would have loved you to attend, but seeing how splendidly you're doing as a teacher... it's just so deeply moving, you know? I'm really happy for you."

Saying this, Hisako-san opened the menu. This café served alcohol, and the usual Hisako-san would have ordered a drink.

"Hisako-san, would you like a drink? I'm driving, so I can take you home."

"No, I'm fine today."

It was unusual for Hisako-san, who loved her drink, to decline. I was thinking such carefree thoughts when she said,

"Listen, Rio."

Her steady gaze made my heart leap.

　I'm weak for this face, this aura, the very existence of Hisako-san.

"Well, you see... there's a baby in my tummy now. I meant to tell you once I was past the critical stage... and I wanted to tell you, Rio, directly."

Hearing her say this with a shy smile, my body cells completely froze.

　—It really made me realise just how thick I am. A message from Hisako-san after so long. Her slightly fuller figure. The fact she suddenly stopped drinking, even though she used to love alcohol.

With all these clues lined up, I should have easily guessed.

That Hisako-san was pregnant.
