Episode One: Worry – December 2032 –

By December, the whole town is thoroughly awash with Christmas spirit.

Admittedly, I do recall family parties from my childhood, but that tradition ended the year my younger brother, four years my junior, started secondary school.

Since then, having neither friends nor a lover, I’d never felt particularly attached to Christmas.

　However, becoming a teacher made me realise just how important events like Christmas and Valentine's Day are for high school students. The passion and energy they pour into them is extraordinary.

"Christmas is getting closer, isn't it? I always get really excited in December."

It seemed Uehara-san was no exception to these high school students. With Christmas just three weeks away, her large eyes sparkled brightly.

"I felt your concentration was lacking a bit more than usual at today's study session. I'm not saying I don't understand the excitement about Christmas, but I want you to be aware that you're starting later than most for your entrance exams and focus on productive studying."

After all, since I was tutoring her one-on-one, her level of concentration was impossible to miss. More than Christmas, what concerned me was Uehara-san's lax attitude towards her exams.

　Uehara-san's results in school tests aren't bad, but that's only relative to a school with an average score of around sixty. If she wants to get into a decent university, she needs to buckle down and study harder to make up for her late start.

Having experienced the so-called brutal entrance exam war myself, I inevitably end up being rather nagging about it.

"I'm doing my best, you know. I definitely think I'm spending more time studying."

"...I see. Let's keep at it, bit by bit, shall we?"

Studying isn't something you force. It's a stance I've consciously adopted since becoming a teacher.

That's why, even if students sleep through my lessons or fiddle with their phones, I haven't reprimanded them. High school isn't compulsory education. Whether they study or not is entirely their own responsibility.

　Consequently, I didn't want to treat Uehara-san any differently... yet I couldn't help feeling anxious about her complete lack of urgency regarding her entrance exams.

"By the way... Christmas, you know? Do you have any plans, Sensei?"

Though thrown off balance by the sudden shift from studying to Christmas, I braced myself, expecting an invitation.

As a teacher, I couldn't possibly accept an invitation from a student, regardless of the reason.

"No, I don't."

"Oh, I see. That's good."

Uehara-san merely seemed relieved and didn't actually invite me.

...Even though I'd refuse if invited, I felt ashamed of myself for finding it odd that she hadn't. When did I become so conceited?

"Er, do you have plans, Uehara-san?"

As if trying to erase my own mistake, or perhaps to confirm she already had prior commitments, I asked her myself.

"I'm going to the Christmas party at the shop where my mum works. She said she'd give me a huge bonus for my part-time wages."

It might sound like an exaggeration, but my eyes nearly popped out of my head.

　Though calling it a shop... if my memory serves me correctly, the place Uehara-san's mother works at isn't a regular eatery. I believe it's a place where the main service involves drinking alcohol with male customers...

"Er, Uehara-san, you're underage, aren't you? I mean, is that... alright?"

"As long as I don't get caught, it's fine, right? I didn't have any plans this year anyway. I'll earn some money."

Uehara-san was calm about it, but I certainly couldn't stay composed.

I know next to nothing about 'those kinds of establishments', but wouldn't I have to worry about being subjected to unpleasant remarks or physical contact? What if someone takes a liking to me, and when I refuse, they fly into a rage or start stalking me?

Precisely because I know nothing, my worries keep growing bigger and bigger, leaving me flustered and panicking all by myself.

"Teacher, you look a bit pale, don't you?"

"Eh⁉ No, no, that's not it at all!　I was just a bit startled, that's all... I'm fine..."

"Does that mean you're against me working part-time?"

She's as perceptive as ever, I suppose. There's no point lying, so I tell her honestly.

"...I am concerned."

"It'll be fine. You seem to have misunderstood a bit, but it's Mum's introduction, right? Mum is called 'Mama' in the shop too, so she's the boss. So if any customer tried anything funny with her daughter, I doubt she'd let them get away with it."

Seeing Uehara-san laugh it off as if it were nothing, I felt like arguing back.

My concern lies before that point. I simply don't want her crossing any bridges that might be even slightly dangerous.

Because I don't fully grasp myself where this feeling stems from – whether it's as a parent, a friend, or a lover – my throat feels tight.

Would she just think I'm being overprotective? Would it exceed the bounds of caution expected of a teacher?

I know that coming from someone who isn't a parent, friend, or lover, my words would be meaningless, just thin words that brush against the ear without leaving a trace. That's why I can't say anything.

"...Even if they pay you well for the part-time job, next year is out of the question, right? This time next year will be when you really need to buckle down."

...I can only say the safe things.

"I know. Mum's told me she'll only pay my tuition fees if I go to university, and I plan to quit my part-time job when I start third year to focus on studying. I need to earn while I can. Oh, and of course I'll apply for the scholarships you told me about too."

Uehara-san really is a very serious girl. Even though she's only seventeen, I think she's a splendid young woman who can act with her future in mind.

"If there's anything you don't understand, whether it's the coursework or the scholarship system, please feel free to ask me. I'll do my best to help."

"Thanks, Sensei. Oh well, I wonder if Father Christmas will bring me presents like money or my university acceptance letter. Hey, Sensei, how old were you when you stopped believing in Father Christmas?"

"He stopped coming to my house, but I still believe in him. He'll surely appear for lots of children again this year."

"Ooh, a grown-up answer! I'll copy that from now on! ...Huh?　Did you just treat me like a child, Sensei?"

"You are a child, after all."

"Well then, I'll be a good girl, so give me a present ♡"

"How about a set of reference books and workbooks?"

"That's genuinely appreciated, but... it's got zero Christmas spirit!"

Uehara-san was laughing, but even as we carried on our usual conversation, the lump in my throat wouldn't budge that day.
