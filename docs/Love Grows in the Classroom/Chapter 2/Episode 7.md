Episode Seven: Rio Kakei: Past Story 4 ―March 2025―

The scenery visible through the window of the moving car looked completely different, even though it was my usual route to school.

I was sure Hisako-san was worried about me, but I was touched by her thoughtfulness in talking to me as usual, trying not to let me feel it.

Feeling her voice and presence more warmly made me finally realise how tense I’d been living. Until now, I’d thought of myself as the type who didn’t let classmates’ harassment bother me, but perhaps that was just what I wanted to believe.

Being with Hisako-san made me feel at ease. When ignored by the entire class, I’d felt a loneliness as though the whole world despised me, but perhaps it was because I could truly feel I wasn’t alone.

“You see, I became a teacher out of necessity.”

　I was gazing out the window when I instinctively looked towards Hisako-san. We'd talked about all sorts of things before, but always trivial matters. This was the first time I'd heard her speak seriously.

"At first, I planned to go to graduate school and become a researcher. But I heard that graduate school is a world full of people far smarter and more passionate than me. I started wondering, 'Do I really want to make my parents pay such high tuition fees just for research?'"

　I couldn't meet Hisako-san's eyes as she kept her gaze fixed ahead while driving. Seizing the moment, I stared intently at her beautiful profile.

"Getting that teaching licence, which I'd sort of taken on a whim, saved me, didn't it? People say teaching is a job with responsibility, but I figured if it didn't suit me, I could just quit straight away."

"...So, how did it feel becoming a teacher? Do you want to quit?"

Hisako-san smiled and shook her head.

"Well, it's tough, early mornings and heavy workloads, but strangely, I don't feel like quitting. Seeing the children grow brings me joy. It seems to suit me."

Hearing her reply, I felt relieved. I was glad teaching us wasn't something Hisako-san disliked.

Yes, she definitely wouldn't show favouritism. Absolutely not.

"...I'll prove that Hisako-san is not the sort of teacher to show favouritism. I'll make sure I'm top of the class in Japanese right up until graduation. Just watch me."

I'd intended to make my declaration to strengthen my resolve, but Hisako-san just tilted her head.

"...Hm? Wait, Rio. How did that happen?"

　Without mentioning Shirogasaki-san's name, I explained how Hisako-san was facing unfounded suspicion because of this test result. She looked troubled until the very end, but then said,

"No, no! Studying with that kind of mindset isn't enjoyable at all! You see, I find talking about classical literature with you incredibly enjoyable. And it's precisely because you feel the same way that studying has been fun for you, leading to this result, right?"

"...True, it wasn't a chore."

"Right? So you don't need to think about difficult things like 'proving this' or whatever! If Rio enjoys learning classical studies, I don't mind at all if people call me a biased teacher."

I felt ashamed that I'd made Hisako-san say all that, and I felt nothing but deep regret towards the teacher who had shown me the joy of classical studies.

"I'm sorry. I nearly made you sad."

"It's alright. ...Listen, Rio. I think I know why that child is being so troublesome... or rather, I have an idea. You don't have to answer, but will you hear me out?"

"Yes," I nodded, and Hisako-san continued.

"Rio, you worked incredibly hard for that final exam, didn't you? Especially in Language and Culture – you improved so much I felt proud as your teacher. It's only natural you came top of the year. So... perhaps they grew jealous. The harder people try, the more bitter they feel when their efforts go unrewarded."

I suppose it's a natural law of the world that effort isn't always rewarded. And if you're unhappy with the result, surely you just need to try harder next time?

"...I don't really understand that feeling..."

"If you don't understand, that's perfectly fine. Listen, Rio. You often say you're 'bad at reading people's emotions', but I think that could also mean you have a big heart towards others."

"I'm just not very interested in other people."

"So don't be so pessimistic. I absolutely adore that about you."

Even after Hisako-san explained it, I still didn't quite grasp Shirogasaki-san's feelings. However, her words did prompt me to reflect on my own words and actions.

If Shirogasaki-san's relentless studying, sacrificing even sleep, had resulted in her consistently topping the year...

　Assuming she's put in twice, perhaps even ten times the effort I have, then when I was asked "How much did you study?" and replied "Just the usual," perhaps the way I said it was problematic too. ...It's possible it could have been taken as belittling Shirogasaki-san's efforts.

If that's the case, whether intentional or unconscious, for Shirogasaki-san it would likely boil down to the thought that I hurt her.

　That was never my intention. I don't mind being hurt myself. But I absolutely detest the idea that my personality might unintentionally hurt someone else.

"...Hisako-san said she liked me, but I realise I have things I need to reflect on too. Even though I'm not good at communicating with others, I need to make an effort to show the basic consideration others deserve."

"Hmm, well done, Rio. Good girl, good girl."

Hisako-san stroked my head with her left hand while steering with just her right.

"Ah, please hold the wheel properly with both hands, it's dangerous."

"Aye."

I sensed something unusual happening inside my own body.

　An unease that once known, there'd be no going back, and a curiosity that refused to be ignored. I desperately suppressed the emotional turmoil I couldn't control.

"...Um, by the way. Where are you heading, Hisako-san?"

I asked, feigning calm. She was driving in a direction completely opposite to the home address I'd given her.

"Somewhere nice ♡"

"I rather question your judgement as an adult. You could get arrested, you know?"

"I wouldn't have known if you hadn't said anything, Rio."

I exhaled softly, watching her serene profile. Whatever I said, it seemed Hisako-san had no intention of taking me straight home.

I stopped protesting out of resignation, and because I was enjoying our drive together. I decided that as soon as I turned eighteen, I would get my full driving licence.
