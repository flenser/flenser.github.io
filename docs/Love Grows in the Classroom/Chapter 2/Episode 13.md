Episode Thirteen: The Christmas Eve Vow ―December 2032―

After swallowing the last strawberry, Uehara-san clasped her hands together politely.

"Ah, that was delicious. Thank you for the meal, Sensei."

"It was nothing special. ...Though I didn't make it myself, mind you."

　I’d thought I’d prepared more than enough food, but Uehara-san polished off everything, right down to the cake. Where did it all go in such a slender frame? Youth is remarkable.

“My mouth’s gone all sweet now. I was thinking of making some coffee, would you like some, Uehara-san?”

“Hmm, I could drink it… but I wouldn’t go out of my way to have it.”

“Then, would you prefer ginger ale or oolong tea…”

"That was before I started liking you, Sensei."

Before I could finish speaking, Uehara-san said this proudly, flashing her white teeth.

"I used to see you drinking coffee all the time, Sensei. I started drinking it because I wanted to like it too. Then we could drink the same coffee together and share the feeling of saying 'It's delicious', right?"

"...Is that so?"

Well, it really is a mystery to me too.

　Today, I discovered so much more about Uehara-san's charm. I received many words that made my heart soar.

But what she said just now struck me the deepest. Just that little thing made my heart flutter so much it felt ridiculous, even to me.

Long ago, when I was asked the same question by Hishako-sensei, the conversation ended with a simple "I don't drink it." Since then, I've tried hard to learn to like coffee.

　It makes me happy that Uehara-san reached out, trying to understand me.

It makes me happy that she tried to like the same things I do.

Yes, I suppose I've realised it all over again.

That Uehara-san truly does like me.

"Hey, Sensei, your face looks a bit red? Are you alright?"

"Eh? I-I don't think it's anything!"

"Oh? Well, that's good then. ...Hey, Sensei. You treated us today, but next year, I want to do it for you. I'll make something really special!"

...'Next year'? Does Uehara-san... mean she's thinking about next year? That she's imagining a future spent together?

　It felt like the kind of unrealistic talk a young child might use when dreaming of grand things, but that was just my own negativity. In reality, it was a promise lying along the extension of the present, 365 days hence.

"W-well... this time next year, I reckon you'll be too busy with exams to be thinking about that sort of thing."

Trying to suppress my elation, I ended up making a snarky remark.

"But hey, having dinner together can't be a bad thing, right? It'd help with motivation!"

"Well... yes. If it helps break up the studying, then let's do it again."

People's feelings change so quickly. There's absolutely no guarantee Uehara-san will still like me next year.

But I felt... somehow incredibly saved by those words, even if they were just for this moment and would be overturned later.

"Ah, a message from Mum. ...Ah, thank goodness. The temp who covered for me today is apparently an amazing cook. Look."

The photo on Uehara-san's phone showed beautifully plated dishes that looked every bit as good as the party food I'd bought.

...Huh? Something felt off.

"Um... Can I ask you something?"

"Hm? What is it, Sensei?"

"...Could it be that the part-time job you were supposed to take... was in the kitchen?"

"Eh? Well, yes?"

—Blimey, so that's what it was...

Only now, at this moment, did I realise the enormous misunderstanding I'd been labouring under, and my face burned. I felt utterly mortified that I'd been worrying needlessly about what I'd do if drunk male customers touched her or tried to chat her up.

"Did you think I'd be serving customers, Sensei?"

Uehara-san, as sharp as ever, seemed to grasp the situation instantly from my expression.

"...Yes, I did."

"Ahaha! Is that why you were so against it?"

Uehara-san was laughing so hard she was holding her stomach, finding my misunderstanding that amusing. ...Was it just my imagination, or did she even seem in a rather good mood?

"Don't worry, Sensei. I wouldn't do anything to make you anxious. A prime catch like you doesn't come along often, does she? I'd recommend you as a girlfriend, honestly."

"Please refrain from taking advantage of the chaos to confess... Honestly, I'm already overwhelmed..."

Lacking both the wit and composure for a clever retort, I could only endure Uehara-san's teasing for a while.

　...Ah well. It was my own misunderstanding and miscalculation that led to this moment, spending time with Uehara-san right now.

Afterwards, Uehara-san gave me hair oil as a Christmas present. Embarrassingly, I'd never used it before in my life, so I had no idea about the going rate or how to use it properly. But I was so touched by the thought that I thanked her repeatedly.

　The problem, however, lay ahead. Having mistakenly believed that preparing party food was my gift, I had nothing tangible to give Uehara-san and could only apologise profusely.

While reflecting on my mistake, Uehara-san compelled me to issue a 'Do Whatever I Say Voucher' as his present.

"I'll be using this when the crucial moment arises, so be prepared ♡"

When exactly would Uehara-san, who smiled bewitchingly as she said this, activate the voucher? I didn't have the courage to ask, "What counts as 'the crucial moment'?" So all I could do was prepare myself mentally.

If we spend next Christmas together, I'll definitely have a present ready.

On that holy night, I made a vow.

　　　　　　　　　　◇

After Uehara-san left, I spent the evening in a room that felt much larger than usual, trying hard not to acknowledge the loneliness I felt. Then a message arrived on my phone.

'I had a lovely time today. I adore you, Sensei.'

What words could I possibly offer her, who always gave me such straightforward sentiments?

If only I could speak only words that reassure you.

If only I could shield your ears from words that might hurt you.

No, the way to make you smile is simpler than that.

I know. All it takes is for me to say just one word, accepting your feelings.

　And yet, in the end, I can do nothing for you.

For me… saying the words you long to hear is simply beyond me.

May everything in this world be kind to you.

Such a wish is surely hypocritical; you value my single word more.

So today, too, we pass each other by.

As long as we remain teacher and pupil, our feelings will never intersect.
