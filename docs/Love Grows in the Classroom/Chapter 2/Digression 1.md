Digression ①: High School Detective Sasaki's Reasoning and Fantasies

Sasaki has a worry right now.

　—Well, calling it a worry might be a slight misnomer. It’s less that she has a worry, and more that she’s utterly restless, desperate to somehow make her best friend Meisa’s clumsy romance succeed… That might be the closest way to describe it.

Meisa, visiting Ryōka’s house, was leaning back against the bed, tapping away at her smartphone. Even though she was my best friend, she really did have a pretty face, Ryōka thought, lying down and watching her.

"Hey, Meisa, could you... you know... do naughty things with Kakei-san?"

Blurting out whatever crossed her mind was one of Ryōka's bad habits.

Meisa seemed unable to process the question immediately. Turning to Ryōka with a look of surprise, she blinked those large eyes often described as having intense power... then flushed bright red.

"...Well, of course I could. I like her, after all."

Though she'd known Meisa for ages, Ryōka hadn't expected such a fresh reaction. When romance came up, Meisa always took a step back, sticking to being the listener and rarely sharing about herself. Even when she did talk, she usually remained expressionless and matter-of-fact.

So seeing her flustered like this was novel. Ryōka felt curiosity and mischief sprouting and growing within her.

"I can't quite picture you and Kakei-san doing that sort of thing."

"You don't have to imagine it!"

Meisa's face was red. Oh dear, she's adorable.

"But seriously, have you never imagined it?"

"Th-that's a different matter altogether, isn't it?"

"...Can I ask? Do you want to hold Kakei-san? Or be held by her?"

"That's asking way too direct! Absolutely not!"

She turned her face away in a huff. After apologising for taking things too far and being forgiven, Sasaki lay back down on the bed, relieved.

Kakei-san's defences were as solid as they appeared. How could Meisa find happiness... While pondering this, her eyelids gradually grew heavy.

　……
　…………

　Ryōka found herself floating in mid-air.

　It seemed she was in the second elective classroom of the West Building. Inside, Kakei-sensei and Meisa were chatting amiably. Ryōka, now insubstantial, observed them from a distance, as if watching a film.

　Ah, this is a dream. Ryōka realised immediately.

　Though she'd never attended the Friday study sessions, she wondered what kind of conversations they always had. Figuring it was just a dream, she drifted closer to eavesdrop.

"The marks from your claws still haven't faded, you know. It was a nightmare trying to hide my back during PE changing."

"I-I'm sorry. B-but... I told you I couldn't take any more, yet Uehara-san wouldn't stop, so I just... lost it..."

"I'm not blaming you. It's my fault for going too far because you're just too adorable."

—What?! That's how it is?!

Ryōka couldn't hide her excitement and agitation, letting out a loud gasp. But this was the dream world after all. No matter how much noise she made, the two of them wouldn't notice her presence.

Judging from their conversation, does that mean Meisa is the one holding onto Kakei-sensei...?　Meisa, who'd always been passive in matters of romance...? Ryōka was acutely aware of her own heart racing.

"...Leaving marks on a pupil's skin is an unforgivable blunder... Neither of us should attempt unfamiliar things. Tonight, I'll do it as usual. Is that alright?"

—Eh⁉ Normally it's the other way round⁉ Ryōka's eyes widened in utter astonishment.

"...Have I ever refused you, Sensei?"

Meisa stared intently at Kakei-sensei.

"My apologies. ...This should be interesting."

With that, Kakei-sensei undid the ponytail binding her hair. She looked almost like a different person... Just as that thought crossed Ryōka's mind, Kakei-sensei stepped down from the lectern and approached Meisa, who was seated.

　Then, with one hand, she ran her fingers through Meisa's hair... placed her hand on her cheek, and kissed her forehead.

—What just happened⁉ Kakei-san, you're being frivolous⁉

The words and actions, utterly unimaginable from the usual Kakei-san, left Ryoka unable to keep up with her reactions.

Meisa gazed at Kakei-san with the face of a young maiden. ... This was the first time she'd ever seen Meisa like this. She'd unexpectedly learned what it felt like when her best friend fell in love. She felt like she shouldn't be watching, but this... she couldn't look away.

"...Sensei, I can't wait any longer."

Their faces drew closer. No, this was definitely going too far. She had to look away!

"...Ryōka."

Suddenly, Meisa's gaze turned to her and her breath caught.

　But they shouldn't be able to see Ryoka in a dream, should they? Why did Meisa call Ryoka's name just now?

"Wake up, Ryoka."

…………
……

She jolted awake. Apparently, Ryoka had fallen asleep on the bed without anyone noticing.

Meisa, who had woken Ryoka, let out a small sigh.

"I didn't want to wake you, you were dead to the world. But I really ought to be off now. Lock up, won't you?"

"...Eh? What about Kakei-san?"

"She's not here, is she? Still half asleep?"

Her exasperated retort gradually brought her mind into focus. But with that clarity came guilt over having dreamt something that felt like an invasion of their personal space.

"...Sorry, Meisa."

"Eh? For falling asleep? I don't mind, really."

Apologising to Meisa, who tilted her head in confusion, as I saw her to the front door... Ryōka really was the type to follow her desires. I couldn't resist the urge to dispel the lingering mist in my chest.

"Hey, Meisa. So, are you the one who ends up holding Kakei-san? Or the one who gets held?"

I felt guilty imagining the two of them like that... but. Asking the person directly should be safe, right?

"I said I wouldn't tell, didn't I? And why did you change your question to sound like it's already a fact⁉"

Naturally, Meisa got angry. Needless to say.
