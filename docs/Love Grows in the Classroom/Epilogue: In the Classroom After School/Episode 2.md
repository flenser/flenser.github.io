Episode Two: To Anyone But the Teacher ―June 2037―

Uehara-san paced around the classroom, her voice brimming with excitement.

"Wow, this brings back memories! I can't believe I was a high school student myself just three years ago!"

Immediately after the first day of teaching practice ended, Uehara-san had half-dragged me to a quiet, unoccupied classroom in another building, insisting she had "something she wanted to discuss".

"...Uehara-san. This 'discussion' is surely..."

"Just an excuse. I wanted to talk to you alone again after so long."

Uehara-san sat in the seat closest to the teacher's desk.

"Usually, teaching practice is done at one's alma mater. It's quite something this school agreed to take you on."

"To build connections and trust, I've got perfect attendance in the regular community volunteer activities this school organises. I'm rather good at remembering faces and having mine remembered!"

"...Your communication skills remain as sharp as ever, I see."

"Well, you're the only teacher I wanted to learn from. I was desperate."

Seeing that carefree smile for the first time in years softened my heart.

"It was because I took your extra lessons that we became friends, wasn't it?"

"That's right. Incidentally, we run student-led study sessions here too. They run twice a week, on Wednesdays and Fridays."

Out of habit, I stepped onto the lectern. Doing this made her high school days come vividly back to me.

"Eh⁉ Wow! You're a popular teacher, aren't you!"

"I wouldn't say popular, but I do think the demand for Japanese teachers is increasing year by year. That's why I'm scheming to get you to help out during your placement period, Uehara-san."

"Is that an order from the placement?"

"Not an order, a request. Since Japanese is your major, I'd really like you to give it a go. It'll be good experience."

I hadn't known which university or faculty Uehara-san had entered until she arrived as a trainee.

It was her first-choice university, the one she'd mentioned wanting to attend back in May when she was still attending the study sessions.

　Uehara-san had entered the Japanese Literature department to study classical literature more thoroughly. I was genuinely delighted that she understood the appeal of the classics and wanted to learn more.

"...Alright, I'll do it! ...But I've heard internships are already incredibly busy. Will that be alright?"

"It'll be fine. With someone like you, Uehara-san."

The reason she started the study group might have been impure, but whenever it was study time, she always concentrated and worked silently and diligently on the problems. Even with her university entrance exams, despite starting so late, she worked incredibly hard and brilliantly secured a place at her chosen university.

With Uehara-san's ability to push herself towards a goal, I could trust her completely.

She would absolutely strive to meet the students' expectations.

"Well, if you say so, I suppose I'll give it my best shot."

Uehara-san peered up at me, revealing her white teeth.

"Hehe, sensei, are you that pleased to see me?"

"Eh? ...That's what you call being overly self-confident."

"Is it? It's written all over your face, though."

I instinctively turned my face away. ...Damn. Such an obvious reaction was tantamount to admitting it. Uehara-san's cheerful voice reached my ears.

"...Well, I am pleased to see your face again after so long. ...Can you still tell? What I'm thinking inside?"

"Of course I can. Because I've been thinking about you all this time."

Those words, similar yet different from what she'd said three years ago.

She spoke with intent, and I understood and accepted their meaning correctly.

I stepped down from the lectern and sat beside her. Sitting shoulder to shoulder like classmates, we looked at each other and smiled.

"You once said it was precisely because we were teacher and pupil that things worked out between us, didn't you?"

"Yes. Had we not been teacher and pupil, I don't believe I could have become close with you, Uehara-san."

But now, I had stepped down from the lectern of my own accord and was sitting beside her.

"Are you enjoying university?"

"Yes, it's great!　There are all sorts of people, you know! Absolutely stunningly handsome blokes, unbelievably clever people, and utterly eccentric, fascinating characters! I've made loads of friends too."

"I see. That's wonderful."

"Yeah. I'm glad I worked hard at my studies. But you know..."

I felt myself almost drawn into the depths of Uehara-san's clear, transparent eyes.

"There wasn't a single person I could like, apart from you, Sensei."
