Episode Six: Chocolate Too Sweet ―February 2033―

Despite tackling rather challenging problems, her accuracy rate was remarkably high.

"Well done, splendid work. Let's call it a day for today's study session."

"Phew, done! Having one-on-one tuition after so long really helped me get through it!"

With a look of satisfaction, Uehara-san stretched while still seated.

　Since joining the study sessions, Uehara-san's Japanese language grades had been steadily climbing. Recognising this as her strong subject would build her confidence, giving her a significant edge in entrance exams and future career choices.

"Sensei."

"Yes... what is it?"

It was a perfectly timed strike, catching me off guard as my thoughts drifted away from Valentine's Day.

　Across the teacher's desk, Uehara-san held out a small, wrapped square box towards me.

Even I could guess what was inside.

Still, unable to process it, I remained speechless.

"I don't believe in giving obligatory chocolates,"

she added, her words earnest and direct.

"...Ah... thank you..."

　I gently accepted her feelings. Though chocolate shouldn't feel heavy at all, it seemed to possess a weighty mass.

"Are you that shocked you're frozen? I thought you'd normally expect to get something from me."

"...I always thought Valentine's Day 'true love' chocolates were something women gave to men..."

"That's not how it works, is it? You're so inexperienced, Teacher, you've become overly intellectual about it."

　I hadn't meant it as a joke, yet Uehara-san chuckled as if I'd given a completely off-the-mark reply.

Why was that? It was simply a matter of receiving chocolate from one student in the classroom after school.

Kindergarten, primary school, junior high, high school, university, working life... Memories from all those years flashed through my mind like a kaleidoscope.

　Watching my life objectively, like a film, I noticed the presence of a girl staring intently at the bright boy on the screen.

A situation that repeated itself, shifting only in time and place.

—These two were me and my younger brother, four years my junior.

Loved by our parents, surrounded by friends, his Valentine's Day was always overflowing with chocolates, likely from many girls who fancied him.

　Until now, it had been a gloomy day where I couldn't help but feel inferior.

But... even if the number of chocolates my brother received was proof of popularity or charm, I no longer cared.

I was happy to have received chocolate from Uehara-san.

It might sound exaggerated, but it felt like I'd been affirmed – that "it's okay for me to fall in love in this world."

　My twisted feelings about Valentine's Day, my inferiority complex towards my brother.

Thanks to Uehara-san, it felt like everything was being purified.

"Hey, Sensei. Are you happy about the chocolate?"

"Yes, I'm very happy."

So when Uehara-san asked me anxiously, I conveyed my gratitude and joy with a sincerity that felt almost sickeningly honest, even to myself.

"I shall treasure it. Though, it seems a shame to eat it straight away. How long would it keep if frozen?"

I hadn't properly examined the contents yet, but assuming it contained several bite-sized chocolates, surely I could eat them properly while keeping one preserved forever?

Lost in thought, Uehara-san exclaimed in surprise.

"I never imagined you'd be so delighted, Professor. It's rather unexpected. All that effort was worth it."

"It's rather embarrassing to be so excited about chocolates at my age... but I have a slightly personal reason."

Uehara-san probably never dreamed it.

That the chocolates she gave me saved my life.

"I see. But I'm truly glad. Why do you think I wanted to go chocolate shopping with you? I wanted to research beforehand what kind of chocolate you like."

"Ah, so that's why you suggested going to the Valentine's Fair. You wouldn't normally go to such lengths, Uehara-san. You'd usually just ask me directly..."

Uehara-san smiled softly.

"No, the usual me wouldn't do. Because it's Valentine's... a day to convey your feelings to someone important."

Valentine's Day is a day when women give chocolate to men. I'd believed that since I was little.

But Uehara-san, no, perhaps children of Uehara-san's generation think differently.

　If she simply sees it as a day to express feelings to 'someone special', then I'm truly delighted.

My cheeks relaxed naturally. Perhaps I was the one most trapped by gender roles when it came to Valentine's Day. Even though I'm a teacher, I keep learning things from Uehara-san.

"What is it, Sensei?"

"I was just thinking how good it is that our perspectives differ."

"What do you mean?"

"You taught me something important. ...Thanks to the age gap, I suppose."

Uehara-san's face lit up brightly.

"Right?"

"I'll make sure to properly return the favour for White Day. Oh, and if you have any requests, please don't hesitate to say."

I've heard it's customary to return threefold, but if I were to include today's gratitude, tenfold wouldn't be enough. I must give my all to the return gift.

　Seeing my enthusiasm, Uehara-san shook her head slightly.

"No need. Instead, there's something I want right now."

Saying that, Uehara-san pulled a square chocolate bar from her bag. It bore no wrapping, its 'Winter Limited Edition' label standing out.

"This is...?"

"I thought it looked delicious, so I bought it as a treat for myself."

"Um... Should I buy the same thing and give it to you as a present?"

"No. Here, Sensei ♡"

Uehara-san opened the wrapper right in front of me and said, looking up at me.

"Open wide and let me feed you?"

"…………Eh?"

"Because I want some chocolate too, you know."

I always felt pathetic, being bossed around by younger women like this.

　But right now, my heart was pounding so hard it hurt.

"Don't... don't just stand there with that deadpan face. Asking for something like this is pretty embarrassing for me too, you know? Ah! I think I'll use that 'Do Anything I Ask' voucher I got for Christmas right here and now! That way, you'll have no choice but to do it, right?"

Uehara-san was speaking a bit quickly, and her cheeks seemed flushed.

　...I suppose I was also feeling giddy, having received chocolate for the first time. Even though we were inside the school, and there was the risk of someone seeing us.

—I truly felt I wanted to grant her any wish she had.

"There's no need to use the voucher."

I pinched a single chocolate from the box Uehara-san held.

"Open your mouth."

　Even though she looked so embarrassed, Uehara-san kept staring intently at my face.

Her obediently parted lips, her glossy tongue, her perfectly aligned teeth – everything seemed utterly bewitching. Perhaps I was unfit to be a teacher.

I dropped the small cube of chocolate into her mouth.

I’d been careful, but my finger brushed her lips slightly as I withdrew it. I desperately tried to look calm.

"...Is it tasty?"

"Yes, it's tasty. ...Much more so than I imagined."

Seeing the satisfied expression on Uehara-san's face brought me relief. Even though I couldn't bear to look directly at her lips and had averted my gaze,

"Would you like some too, Sensei?"

When she offered the chocolate to my lips, even someone as clueless as me understood the implication. I tentatively opened my mouth a little, and Uehara-san pressed the chocolate in.

"Is it nice?"

"...It's a bit too sweet for me..."

Glancing sideways at the excited Uehara-san, I found myself genuinely craving black coffee.

I adore sweet things and chocolate, but this was the sweetest thing I'd ever tasted.
