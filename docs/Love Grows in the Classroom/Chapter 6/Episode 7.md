Episode Seven: The Teacher's Purpose ―March 2033―

Though around ten students had been attending the recent study sessions, I assumed that with both the term-end exams and mock tests over, Uehara-san would be the only one coming to the study sessions again.

But my prediction was unexpectedly proven wrong.

　Stepping into the second elective classroom in the west building after school on Friday, I was utterly speechless.

Sitting in the seat closest to the lectern, her usual spot, Uehara-san wore an expression of astonishment just like mine.

"This is incredible, sir! It's the first time so many people have gathered, right⁉"

As I stood before the lectern, Uehara-san looked visibly excited.

"Yes... I... I wonder what's happened...?"

I couldn't believe thirty students from different years and classes had gathered. As I stood there dumbfounded, a female student raised her hand.

"Kakei-san. About this study session, my friends from the tennis club want to join too. Is there anything we can do about the clash with club activity times?"

"Er... well, yes... club activity breaks vary by club, so as for which days the tennis club could come..."

While he was trying to recall which days were their break, a male student spoke up.

"It's not like attendance is compulsory, so using the term 'arrangements' is a bit odd, isn't it?"

"Honestly, Kakei-san's study sessions are spreading by word of mouth and getting more and more popular. They're bound to get packed soon. If we don't make it twice a week or split it into two sessions, won't everyone who wants to join end up unable to attend?"

Another boy who'd been attending regularly lately chimed in. Right, if it's a problem that can be solved simply by increasing the number of study sessions, then that would be the best approach.

"But wouldn't that put a huge burden on Kakei-san? This isn't paid work, is it? ...I know it might sound hypocritical coming from me, since I'm the one who spread the word about how good these sessions are..."

　The one who said that was Higashi-kun, who had previously asked me about the study group.

Higashi-kun's attendance rate at the study group was exceptionally high, and in this term's final exams, his scores had improved in both Modern Japanese Literature and Language and Culture. I was pleased that he, having achieved results, was now helping to promote the study group.

I wanted to start the study session soon, but the students' discussion was only escalating. There must be students feeling troubled. I needed to calm this commotion down for now.

"Ah, um... I..."

"Prioritise things? Start with the upper years, ~~"

"Students struggling with Japanese should be prioritised, ~~"

I found myself swept up in the momentum of the students' exchange of opinions and couldn't get a word in. ...While it's wonderful that they're actively sharing their views...

This study group isn't mine; it belongs to the students. If they can reach a conclusion on their own initiative, that's perfectly fine. We should leave it to the students' initiative... but that's not quite right either. I'd feel terribly guilty towards the students who came here today purely wanting to study.

Just as I took a breath to speak up again,

"Excuse me, just a moment."

A quiet yet resolute voice cut through the noisy classroom. Toward the source of that voice, every single student in the room turned their attention to Uehara-san at once.

"Can't we discuss that after the study session? I'm here to study. Let's start on time, please, teacher."

As soon as Uehara-san spoke, everyone seemed to wake up, the atmosphere shifting completely in agreement.

"...You're right. Sorry, Kakei-san. Let's begin."

Prompted by the male student, I snapped to attention and straightened my back.

"Ah... yes. Right then, everyone, please take out the workbooks you brought..."

As the students, now switched into study mode, began tackling their respective workbooks, I glanced at Uehara-san, careful not to be too obvious.

Of course, objectively speaking, I thought her point was perfectly valid. But I also felt that the fact it was Uehara-san who voiced it was the main reason the commotion had died down.

　Though I treat Uehara-san as just another pupil, as a child, to the other students within the school she is a highly conspicuous figure. Everyone tends to fixate on her every move.

　I quietly averted my gaze from her, silently solving problems. Despite being seven years younger, she possessed something I lacked, and I felt nothing but admiration for her.

I caught myself thinking that if I spent any more time with her, I would surely... and looked down, as if to dispel those improper thoughts.

I was standing at the lectern.

I must never mistake my own purpose.
