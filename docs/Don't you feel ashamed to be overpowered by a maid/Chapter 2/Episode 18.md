Returning to the room with Alisha, Lotte helped her change her clothes.\
Once she had finished changing,

"I'm sorry."

Suddenly, Alisha said this and bowed her head towards Lotte.

"!? A-Alisha-sama, what on earth...! Please raise your head!"\
"...I was so absorbed in my knightly duties that I neglected matters at the estate. I never imagined anyone would do such a thing."\
"...It can't be helped. I understand what those people were saying too."\
"That's no excuse—"\
"Besides, I was truly grateful for Lady Alisha's help. Thank you."

Interrupting Alisha's words, Lotte expressed her gratitude.\
　Then,

"But still, I feel it might be unreasonable for me to continue as a maid here."

She continued.\
It wasn't just about fulfilling Lady Alisha's wish; she also didn't get along well with the other maids.\
She was glad to have returned, but Lotte couldn't help feeling this place was beneath her.

"...I can understand why you resigned once. You could even say the responsibility lies with me."\
"It wasn't your fault, Miss Alisha! After all, you're busy with your knight duties, and it's us hired staff who should be managing the household..."\
"I'll speak to the Head Maid to ensure such things don't happen again and that she provides stricter guidance."

Whether that would truly work was uncertain —but Lotte's mind was already made up.

"So please... don't leave."

Saying this, Alyssa grasped the hem of Lotte's dress imploringly.\
The sight was reminiscent of an abandoned puppy —Lotte's resolve, which should have been unshakeable, wavered easily.\
Without Lotte, there would surely be no problems arising between the maids.\
Everything would remain as it was —so leaving was the right thing to do.\
　Even though Lotte had done terrible things to Alisha —Alisha needed Lotte.\
She had come this far wanting to be useful to the person she admired, yet she had run away once.\
And now she was trying to run away again —was that right?\
If Lotte quit being a maid now, it would hurt Alisha.\
Lotte couldn't possibly do that.

"...That's rather unfair of you, Miss Alisha."\
"...Lotte?"

This time, Lotte took Alisha's hand and clasped it.\

"Miss Alisha needs me, doesn't she?"\
"O-of course! Well, if you call that an impure motive, then perhaps it is, but it's not just that—"\
"No need for excuses. After all, I'm the only one holding onto Lady Alisha's secret, aren't I?"\
"Hmph."

When Lotte said that, Alisha wore an expression that was both delighted —and yet, embarrassed.\
What would everyone think if they knew the perfect Princess Knight enjoyed being teased like this —but no one would ever know.\
Because this was a secret just between the two of them.

"Very well. I shall grant Your Highness's wish."\
"...! Does that mean you'll become my personal maid!?"

Alyssa pressed forward eagerly.\
Alyssa was quite fixated on having a personal maid, but it wasn't something Lotte could accept in her current position.\
—Besides, there must be someone far more suited to being Alyssa's personal maid.

"N-no. Merely as one maid among others —to support Lady Alisha."\
"Oh, so that's what you meant..."

Hearing Lotte's words, Alisha wore a slightly disappointed expression.

"Ah, if that's your attitude, then I don't—"\
"No, no, I'm lying! I'm really happy! So please don't quit!"

She looked like a child throwing a tantrum —a side of Alisha Lotte had never seen before.\
　No —Lotte probably still didn't know the real Alisha.\
So she'd have to learn about her from now on—Lotte chuckled softly.

"I was joking. I won't say I'm quitting anymore."

Even Lotte herself was surprised she'd found the composure to joke.

"...Really?"\
"Yes. Though I'm not sure yet if I can live up to your expectations, Alisha-sama."\
"Lotte, you'll be fine."\
"...Where does that confidence come from?"

—After that exchange, they both laughed.\
And so —their secret relationship was renewed.
