――About a month passed, and at the Zekrosia residence in the royal capital.\
Lotte was once again clad in her maid's uniform, standing by Alisha's side.\
The Zekrosia residence was located near the very heart of the royal capital, clearly signifying their standing.

The tension of working in such a place again – honestly, it was a heavy burden for Lotte.\
　It was a decision made in response to Alisha's wish for her to become her personal maid.\
However, Lotte had merely returned to being a maid.\
Her position remained that of a lowly servant, not a personal maid.\
Indeed, there had been no precedent of a lowly servant like Lotte being suddenly promoted to personal maid.\
The only change was that she was now entrusted with attending to Alisha's personal needs.\
　Even if not exclusive, being able to work by Alisha's side meant Lotte's wish had come true.\
Seeing Lotte return, the other maids couldn't hide their surprise.

They didn't say anything openly, but she could tell they were giving her the cold shoulder.\
"After quitting once" – Lotte understood perfectly well why they felt like saying that.\
　Truthfully, Lotte hadn't intended to return at all.\
But when Alisha herself asked her... it wasn't something she could easily refuse.\
After much hesitation, the choice Lotte made was to return as a lowly maid.\
Still, she couldn't help but feel uncomfortable.\
Of course, not all the maids disliked Lotte.

"I'm tired, so I'll rest for a bit."

　She informed the other maids thus before returning to her own room.\
Yet, amongst them, one person alone—

"Lotte, could you help me change?"\
"H-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-

"Why would a returnee..."

—She thought she heard those words before entering the room.\
It seemed rather spiteful to make it audible only to Lotte.\
Still, trying her best not to mind — Lotte followed Alisha inside.\
With a soft click, the door closed, leaving only Lotte and Alisha in the spacious room.\
　Alyssa said she was going to change, then sat down on a chair and addressed Lotte.

"Have you made up your mind about becoming my personal maid?"

—It seemed she hadn't given up after all.

"...I can't be a personal maid. Even being a regular maid is, well, too much for me."

She answered somewhat evasively.\
—She couldn't explain to Alisha why she felt uncomfortable.\
For Lotte, who found even being an ordinary maid difficult to sustain, taking on a personal maid was simply beyond her means.

"Even though I'm asking you so earnestly, is it really impossible?"\
"Ugh..."

—Alisha, in her Knight Princess attire, looked incredibly dignified and impressive.\
　Yet now, having shed her armour, she wore not the red-and-white knight's attire but a princess's formal dress, revealing glimpses of that adorable, pleading charm.\
Honestly, Lotte felt herself almost swayed, but she shook her head slightly.

"N-No."\
"Absolutely not?"\
"Absolutely not."\
"If you just listen to me, I'll grant you any wish you have?"\
"...!?"

Alyssa saying that much made her gasp involuntarily.\
After all, what was being requested was to become her personal maid – essentially a promotion.\
Probably, if any other maid besides Lotte had been asked by Alyssa, they wouldn't have refused.\
Because being Alyssa's personal maid was the dream of everyone working here.\
Naturally – it had been Lotte's dream too.

"...I still can't do it."

Lotte answered, her gaze lowered.

"You're surprisingly stubborn, aren't you?"\
"...I'm sorry."\
"I'm not blaming you. Well, I can't force you after all."

Even Alisha, faced with Lotte's firm refusal, backed down.\
Lotte felt deeply apologetic, but she simply couldn't live up to Alisha's expectations.

"We'll put the exclusive maid matter on hold for now—but I absolutely must have you grant me one other favour."\
"...A favour, you say?"\
"Yes. That's precisely why I asked you to return as a maid."

Even if she couldn't be an exclusive maid, Lotte accepted the request to return as a maid.\
If Alisha had gone out of her way to ask Lotte, there must be some reason.

"So, this request is...?"\
"I want you to help relieve my stress."\
"Huh! Relieving stress — that means... that thing we discussed, doesn't it?"

At Lotte's words, Alisha gave a slight nod.
