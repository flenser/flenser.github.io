――Within the dimly lit room, its curtains drawn tight, the creaking of a bed echoed.\
It was spacious enough for one person to live in, its décor exuding an air of refinement.\
Upon the large bed lay the figures of two young girls.

"Can you move?"

A black-haired girl, clad in predominantly black garments and wearing a white apron, asked this.\
She was merely a maid working in this mansion —nothing more, nothing less.\
Yet before her lay another girl, bound with rope.\
Her long, beautiful, lustrous golden hair clung slightly to her body with sweat.\
　Her finely chiselled, dignified features bore a flushed, almost intoxicated glow, her breathing ragged.\
The sheer negligee, revealing her undergarments, only heightened the provocative nature of her current state.

"...Perhaps we should stop?"

The bound girl murmured, her voice catching.\
　Her hands were securely bound behind her back, the ropes tied in a way that emphasised her chest —there was no easy escape.\
As proof, all she could do was fidget, rocking the bed and making the ropes creak.\
Hearing her words, the maid narrowed her eyes and gently stroked the bound girl's thigh.

"...!"

Her body twitched slightly.\
She made movements as if to escape, yet offered little real resistance.

"You were the one who came on to me."\
"Th-that..."

At the maid's words, the bound girl's gaze darted around.\
Yes —she was entirely responsible for this situation.\
It was because she desired it that things had come to this.\
　The maid girl abruptly stopped her hand, which had been stroking the thigh.

"Ah..."

The bound girl let out a faint, almost pleading sound, then flushed with shame upon realising what she'd done.

"If you truly dislike it, I'll stop."

The maid girl declared —fully aware herself how rather spiteful her words sounded.\
　Shaking her head slightly, the bound girl shook it without words.\
She didn't want it to stop —that was it.\
After all, it was what she had desired.\
The maid girl gave a small chuckle and smiled faintly, then reached out her hand once more —touching her gently.\
This was a secret time for just the two of them, known to no one else —the maid and the princess knight's private affair.
