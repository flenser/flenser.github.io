"T-tie? You mean... tie up? You mean I'm supposed to tie up... Lady Alisha?"\
"Alice."\
"...You mean tie up Alice?"\
"Exactly that. There was a scene in a book I bought earlier where they were doing that sort of thing."

—Meaning they were engaging in acts involving binding with rope.\
　Lotte wasn't particularly knowledgeable about such matters, but she'd heard people had such inclinations, and had indeed seen it depicted in books she'd read.\
Binding, being bound —it seemed Alisha had developed an interest in such practices too.

"But this is outdoors... Surely it's far too dangerous...?"

Had this been within the mansion —though hesitant, she might have granted Alisha's wish.\
　But this is outside, and even in a deserted back alley, anyone could turn up at any moment.\
What would happen if they were discovered in such a place?

"Just lightly, please. We can do the proper thing another time, alright?"

――Lotte didn't quite grasp what 'proper' meant either, but Alisha was full of enthusiasm.\
Even if Lotte refused here, she surely wouldn't back down.\
　Having sworn to grant her wish —Lotte had no choice but to steel herself.

"...If it's just lightly, then. So, how should I do it?"\
"Front might be too easy for you to untie yourself, so behind your back might be better?"

Saying that, Alisha slipped off her robe and clasped her hands behind her back.\
—Lightly, then the front would be better, Lotte thought, but she proceeded to loop the rope around Alisha's hands anyway.\
　What kind of situation is this —she mustn't lose her composure.\
Checking to ensure it wasn't too tight, Lotte bound Alisha's arms with the rope.

"How... how is it? Does it hurt?"\
"Hmm, well. I think... it's fine."

Taking Alisha's word for it, she tied it in a way that could be undone relatively easily.\
Though, for Alisha, bound as she was, it wouldn't be simple to untie.\
　Alyssa moved her bound arms as if to check them—

"...I can't move, can I?"

She murmured her observation in a small voice.

"Well, I suppose that's because I've tied you up."

The creaking sound of the rope reached her ears —Alyssa seemed to be trying to free herself.\
Lotte kept watch, checking that no one was approaching.

"...It's true, being unable to move does make one feel rather... peculiar."

Alisha spoke like this, her breathing slightly uneven.\
Seeing Alisha enjoying being bound and unable to move —Lotte gasped.\
Then, she whispered softly to Alisha.

"Could it be... that you're excited by being tied up, since no one's watching?"\
"Hmph!"

Caught out, Alisha showed a hint of fluster.

"N-no, I'm not excited or anything..."\
"Really? You seem rather breathless, though."\
"This is because the rope is sturdier than I thought and won't come undone..."

It was an excuse, but it was probably true.\
　If they came undone easily, Alisha would surely be dissatisfied.\
In a way, Lotte's consideration had paid off —yet Alisha was now struggling even more desperately to free herself.\
But no matter how much she writhed, the ropes wouldn't budge.

"Hah, hah..."

Her breath was ragged —would Alisha, who trained regularly, become this flustered merely because she couldn't untie herself?\
　Watching her like this stirs a sadistic urge within Lotte.\
Within her, as if another person were whispering —words form of their own accord.

"Right now, you couldn't resist anything done to you, could you? What would you like to try?"\
"Wh-what do you mean? Asking me suddenly like that..."

　Lotte's words left Alisha looking bewildered.\
Just moments ago she'd been begging to be bound herself —yet when the moment came, nothing seemed to spring to mind.\
I stroked upwards along the curve of Alisha's thigh.

"H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-

"Since Alice can't seem to answer, I thought I'd just go ahead and do it myself."

These were words the usual Lotte would never utter —yet, why?\
Seeing her provocative form, the words flowed naturally from her lips, her body moving of its own accord.\
As if she understood exactly what the other desired.\
Or perhaps —Lotte possessed such a talent.\
　Stroking Alisha without permission while she was immobilised was, in truth, an utterly unacceptable act, and not one Lotte would normally do.\
But right now, she felt Alisha wanted it.\
Indeed, though clearly bewildered, Alisha showed no sign of disliking it.\
Rather, she was holding back, stifling her voice.

"...!"

　From her thigh, she stroked towards her lower abdomen, then teased her side with a tickling touch.\
Alisha's startled flinch amused her.\
Gradually, Lotte found herself losing all restraint.\
Whatever she did —the reality that Alisha couldn't resist was right before her eyes.\
Just then, approaching footsteps reached Lotte's ears.
