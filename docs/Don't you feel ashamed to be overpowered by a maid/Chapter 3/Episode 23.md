"A-Alisha-sama!?"\
"Now then. It's Alice, isn't it?"\
"A-Alice... What are you...?"\
"Lotte's reaction was rather amusing, so I couldn't help myself."

—Even if her reaction was amusing, being subjected to this might prove too much for Lotte's heart.\
Though her hands were adorably small —it was precisely because she wielded a sword that her palms felt substantial.\
　Lotte squeezed back, as if to confirm that hand.

"So you really do train, then."\
"You can tell? I practise diligently every day —though I try to keep it discreet, I do have scars on my skin."

Saying this, Alisha rolled up her sleeve.\
Indeed, small scars were visible on her white, beautiful skin.

"It makes me rather pleased when someone notices these. It feels like all the effort was worthwhile."\
"I-I was just, um, saying what caught my attention..."\
"That's what makes me happy. I'd like to see other sights too, but —before that, shall we go to our intended destination? There happens to be a shop nearby."

They nearly forgot their original purpose.\
　Led by Alisha, they arrived at a shop selling accessories and various other sundries.\
Rings and necklaces were displayed too, but all were inexpensive and aimed at commoners —a place where nobles like Alisha would rarely be seen.\
In fact, it was surprising that Alisha even knew of such a shop.

"...I rather think this isn't the sort of shop where nobles would usually come, is it?"

I murmured softly, almost whispering into Alisha's ear.

"I looked into it beforehand. Besides, just because you're a noble doesn't mean you only wear expensive things, does it? Especially someone like me, who juggles being both a noble and a knight —wearing expensive items carries the risk of losing them, doesn't it? So sometimes, cheaper things are preferred."\
"I-I see."

　Now that she mentioned it, it made sense. Besides Alisha, many others served as knights while holding noble titles.\
Nobility equating to expensive things —that was Lotte's preconception. She tended to be overwhelmed by the size of their mansions, but thinking back, Alisha's room, while neat and tidy, contained no luxury items among its decorations.\
Perhaps Alisha herself simply had no interest in such things.

"Well then, choose whatever you like that suits me."\
"But, but, 'whatever I like'..."

A sudden unreasonable request —yet that was the agreement that brought her here.\
Though told to choose freely, the decision had already been made: it had to be a choker. Lotte focused mainly on the neatly displayed chokers.\
　The pricier ones seemed reasonably expensive, but still within Lotte's means.\
She had to find something from here that would suit Alisha.

(...W-which one should I choose?)

To be honest, Lotte had little experience buying such things and had no idea which would be best.\
Meanwhile, Alisha seemed to be enjoying herself, wandering around the shop while Lotte made her selection.

(Something that would suit Miss Alisha...)

They all seemed like they might suit her, but —suddenly, a choker caught her eye and she picked it up.\
It was a simple design, but at its centre was an accessory shaped like a star —and Lotte felt this one would be perfect for Alisha.

"Decided?"\
"Huh!?"

Startled by the sudden voice, she jumped.

"Er, well, I thought this might be nice... It's not terribly expensive, though."\
"Price doesn't matter. It's what Lotte thought was good, isn't it?"\
"That's... well, yes."

After a moment's hesitation, Lotte nodded.\
She thought this was good —Alisha took it from Lotte and headed straight to the shopkeeper.

"I'll take this one."\
"Right then."

Instant decision —Alisha showed no sign of hesitation.\
After purchasing the choker, Alisha immediately took Lotte with her —this time heading towards a deserted back alley.\
Taking the newly bought choker out of the paper bag,

"Would you mind putting this on right away?"

She said this, addressing Lotte.

"I-is this where?"\
"Of course. Since you took the trouble to choose it."

Perhaps this swiftness of action was something worth emulating.\
Lotte complied, fastening the choker around Alisha's neck.\
Even with its simple design adorned with a pendant, the moment Alisha wore it, it looked like a noble piece.

"I-it's on."\
"How does it look?"\
"Y-yes. It suits you very well."

Saying that something she had chosen herself suited her felt somehow embarrassing, and she answered while instinctively averting her eyes.

"By the way, do you remember our promise?"\
"...A promise?"

They had agreed to go buy the choker today, but she had no recollection of making any other specific promise.\
Looking at Alisha's expression, there was an air of expectation about her.

"...Well, when I wear the choker, it's a signal to summon you, isn't it? So —I'd like you to grant my wish starting now."\
"—"

Alisha's words unsettled Lotte.\
A wish made while wearing the choker meant it probably wasn't an ordinary one.\
Something only the two of them could do, an act they couldn't be seen doing.\
　This was an alleyway, certainly deserted, but still—

"Wh-what exactly do you mean, 'do something' here? Surely you don't expect me to—?"\
"I have no intention of asking for that sort of thing."

She breathed a sigh of relief.\
Even if it was Alisha's wish, she couldn't possibly comply if asked to —well, you know —here.\
　Alisha took something else from the paper bag she held.\
It seemed to be something she'd bought while Lotte was choosing the choker.

"...Rope? Why on earth would you need that?"

Facing Lotte's puzzled stare, Alisha answered with a small smile.

"I want you to try tying me up with this."\
"...Eh?"

　—It felt like she was asking for something considerably more difficult than simply pushing her down.
