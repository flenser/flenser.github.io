Lotte and Alisha returned to the mansion sometime after noon.\
By now, evening was drawing near —Lotte had quietly made her way back to Alisha's room.\
　She had instructed the head maid that 'Alisha is resting alone in her room', ensuring no one approached.\
It was more effective than Lotte relaying the message herself; everyone obeyed that way.\
No one would imagine Alisha remained bound within the room.\
—Or perhaps she had already cut the ropes.\
Truthfully, Lotte didn't believe Alisha would remain as she was.\
　If anything happened, she'd cut the ropes herself and escape.\
It was her way of saying, if you want them off, you can do it yourself – a sort of payback for all the trouble Lotte had been put through.\
Lotte knocked on the door and called out.

"Lady Alisha, it's Lotte. May I come in?"

There was no immediate reply – or perhaps she wasn't in the room at all.

"Excuse me."

But confirmation was necessary —the door wasn't locked. In the slightly dimmed room, Alisha lay on the bed.\
She was still dressed as when she'd left, her hands bound behind her back —meaning she was still tied up.\
She didn't seem to notice Lotte entering the room, breathing heavily through her shoulders.\
For a moment, she looked unwell, and Lotte immediately called out.

"A-Alisha-sama...!? Are you all right!?"\
"Ah, Lotte... You've finally come back, haven't you?"

Alisha offered a faint smile.\
Observing her, Lotte noticed Alisha seemed to be straining her lower abdomen—and instantly understood her predicament.

"...When you can't move, this sort of thing happens."\
"Yes, I suppose. Truthfully —it was fine until I became conscious of it."

Judging by her distinctly pained expression, she must be nearing her limit.\
Alisha hadn't been to the toilet since leaving the mansion.\
Meaning she'd been holding it in the entire time until Lotte returned.\
Though relieved she wasn't ill —not entirely.\
She was on the verge of wetting herself.\
　Even so —Lotte didn't immediately untie Alisha's bonds, instead asking as if to confirm.

"...You could have cut the ropes yourself, couldn't you?"

Her gaze flickered towards the sword beside the bed.\
Alisha could undoubtedly have freed herself using the sword.\
Or —using magic would have been perfectly acceptable too.\
That was precisely why remaining bound all this time meant it was Alisha's own choice.

"Because this is the punishment I was given, isn't it?"\
"——"

Lotte's eyes widened at Alisha's words.\
It was true —this was the punishment Lotte had given her.\
It was a chastisement, and Alisha had accepted it, enduring it all along.\
In other words, she had shown remorse.

"So, will you forgive me?"

Yes, Alisha had asked.\
　How noble of her —her form, surely nearing its limit, appeared profoundly endearing.\
Yet, her ragged breaths reached Lotte's ears, causing her to start with a sudden expression.

"W-well, yes. This time —I shall forgive you. Before that, however, I think you ought to hurry to the lavatory first."

Lotte hastily untied the ropes binding Alisha.\
　Alisha looked slightly reluctant to let go —but now was no time for hesitation.

"You're free. Um, are you alright on your own?"\
"Eh, yes. I should just about make it."

Alisha's willingness to comply so readily likely meant she truly was nearing her limit.\
She left the room and returned a short while later, looking refreshed.

"Honestly, if you'd been any later getting back, it might have been dangerous."\
"...If this teaches you anything, please stop asking me to do such risky things outside."

Whether she was actually prompting reflection or not —Alisha nodded at Lotte's words.

"Yes. It certainly must have been a burden for you... I'm sorry."

A sincere apology —if she truly was reflecting, Lotte felt relieved.

"But... there's something else that might become a bit of a habit."\
"...Excuse me?"\
"That feeling of being right on the edge of letting it go... the act of holding it back..."

—What on earth is she talking about? Lotte wore an expression of utter disbelief.\
Lotte let out a small sigh.

"...The sight of you saying such things without a shred of embarrassment —if anyone but me saw that, it really would be the end."

Not only the sight of her holding back the urge to urinate, but Alisha saying it was becoming a 'habit' —no one else had ever seen that, nor could they even imagine it.\
Even Lotte, who'd witnessed it right before her eyes, couldn't help but be utterly dumbfounded.

"That's fine."

Yet Alisha continued, wearing a confident expression.

"I have no intention of showing that side to anyone but you."\
"Hmph."

Was it a case of being caught off guard?\
A special side she only showed Lotte —even if it was overflowing with shame, it was something no one else could see.\
Perhaps Lotte, who found such things special, wasn't exactly ordinary either.\
Uncertain whether to simply be pleased, Lotte wore a look of confusion.

"Aren't you pleased?"\
"...I don't know."

There was no way she couldn't be pleased —yet Lotte could only respond in that way.
