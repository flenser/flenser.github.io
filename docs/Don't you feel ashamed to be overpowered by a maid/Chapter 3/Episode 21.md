――The next day.\
From early morning, Lotte was in an alleyway a short distance from the mansion.\
She had obtained prior permission from the Head Maid and was supposed to be out.\
However, she hadn't mentioned going out with Alisha.\
She'd been told to keep that point hidden by Alisha.\
A consideration, one might say, to ensure no one realised Lotte was connected to Alisha.\
　Lotte wasn't in her maid uniform either, but in casual clothes —a rare occurrence for her, having lived in her maid dress since returning here.

"—Sorry, I am be a bit late."

The one who appeared, saying this, was Alisha, her hood pulled low over her eyes.\
She, who usually wore the princess's formal attire, was also in civilian clothes today —the robe was to conceal her identity.\
　It was a short, trouser-style outfit, but it suited Alisha very well.

"Well? Does it suit me?"\
"Y-yes. But I thought you might be wearing something a bit more flashy, like a dress."\
"I don't dress to stand out, you know. I'm incognito. Besides, I prioritise ease of movement."\
"Ease of movement?"\
"I am a knight. I must be ready to move at any moment —I'm always mindful of that."

　Come to think of it, when Lotte had reunited with Alisha, she'd been wearing similar attire.\
Even while concealing her identity, she strives to be ready for action as a knight at a moment's notice —that earnestness is very much her character.

"Today, we're not going out as master and maid, strictly as friends. Keep that in mind."\
"F-Friends...? That feels rather presumptuous—"\
"Can't you be friends with me?"

Alisha peered at Lotte as she asked.\
Asked like that, Lotte couldn't refuse.

"Ugh, alright. I'll do my best..."\
"Hehe, nice to meet you. I've never had anyone I could go out with like this before —I'm looking forward to it."

Alisha said this with a genuinely delighted smile.\
　—Indeed, having trained relentlessly as a knight since childhood, and being the daughter of a great noble house.\
Going out normally with a friend like this might be something she'd never experienced.\
Of course, for Lotte, considering Alisha an equal friend felt far too presumptuous, but if that was what Alisha desired, she wanted to be that for her as much as possible.

(Though I don't know if I can manage it...)

　She murmurs to herself, her voice faint and uncertain.\
—Truth be told, Lotte herself has no one she can truly call a friend.\
In the frontier lands, there were few her own age, and since coming here —well, needless to say.\
That Alisha calls her a friend brings Lotte genuine joy.

"Right then, shall we be off?"

Alisha says this, takes Lotte's hand, and starts walking.\
　Holding hands, walking side by side like this —it really felt like a date.\
Her heart pounded so hard it hurt, and though it had only just begun, she wondered if her body could hold out.

"Ah, wait a moment!"

But almost as soon as they started walking, Alisha let go of Lotte's hand and dashed off somewhere.\
Lotte checked the spot where Alisha's hand had been, feeling a pang of loneliness.

"—Wait, Miss Alisha…"

The moment Lotte spoke those words —Alisha leapt into the air and returned with lightning speed.\
Before Lotte could even marvel at her nimble footwork, Alisha placed her index finger to her lips and said.

"Calling my name out here would give us away. We're out incognito, after all."\
"I-I'm sorry. But then, what should I call you...?"\
"How about 'Alice'?"\
"Alice, you say?"\
"Yes! When it's just the two of us, call me Alice. That's what I used to be called."

So, Alice was her nickname —but likely only her family used it, and only those closest to her.

"But, but... surely it's too much for someone like me to..."\
"Don't put yourself down like that. I'm asking you. Go on, try saying it?"\
"But..."\
"Oh, very well. Fine then —this is an order from your master. Call me Alice."

　—An order.\
Hearing it put that way, she felt somewhat relieved.\
Even if told to act like a friend, it wasn't something Lotte could manage easily.\
So, an order —as if convincing herself, Lotte opened her mouth.

"A-Alice...?"\
"What is it, Lotte?"\
"Hmph."

For Lotte, it carried devastating force —she offered it again, wearing that pleased smile.

"See? Easy, wasn't it? Right then, I'm off to that stall over there."\
"Th-the stall?"

Glancing over, she saw a stall where someone was skewering and grilling some sort of meat.
