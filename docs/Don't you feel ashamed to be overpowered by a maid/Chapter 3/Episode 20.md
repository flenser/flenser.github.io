――Several days had passed since Lotte returned to the Zekrosia household.\
The main change was that the whispering behind Lotte's back had ceased.\
Perhaps they'd simply stopped speaking within earshot of her – but even that alone made things considerably more bearable.\
Still, this didn't mean relations with the maids she'd previously clashed with would immediately improve.\
　She remained somewhat isolated, regarded as a difficult maid to handle.\
Still, Lotte held no higher standing than the other maids; aside from being summoned by Alisha, she remained a lowly servant.\
Hanging laundry, cleaning the mansion —as she went about her daily tasks, Alisha summoned her once more.\
Knocking and entering the room, she found Alisha dressed in her princess's formal attire once again.\
　Alyssa, who had seldom returned to the manor before, had recently begun showing herself there more often.\
One might call it putting words into action —she seemed particularly concerned about the manor's maids, especially Lotte.\
While it was helpful and welcome, Lotte worried it might be placing a burden on Alyssa.

"Sorry for calling you. Was now a good time?"\
"Of course it is —but Lady Alisha, you've been returning to the manor quite often lately... I mean, is everything alright with your work?"\
"It's fine. I haven't been called out on expeditions much lately. So I thought I'd get on with the work I can do, like preparing and checking necessary documents."

Naturally, she couldn't take classified information that mustn't leak outside back to work on —but apparently, preparing reports and such could be done anywhere.\
　She seemed to have been drafting something, but Alisha set down her pen and began speaking.

"More importantly, I summoned you today for one reason: our secret agreement."\
"A secret agreement...?"

The ominous tone made Lotte unable to hide her unease.

"Is something wrong?"\
"Wrong... well, hearing it stated like that..."

It felt rather embarrassing —there was no doubt she was bound to Alisha in that manner.

"Being embarrassed about it now makes things rather complicated for me too —ahem. Anyway. I think we should decide on a signal between us going forward."\
"...A signal, you say?"\
"Yes. Naturally —as your maid, I'll be handling your daily affairs, won't I? Being summoned without knowing which one of us it is would be a burden for you, wouldn't it?"

It seemed this proposal was made with Lotte's well-being in mind.\
Indeed, being summoned without any mental preparation —it would certainly be a significant psychological burden.\
Alyssa's suggestion was appreciated, though.

"Er, what sort of signal would that be?"\
"I've been thinking about it all night."\
"All... all night...?"

She'd clearly given it considerable thought —Alyssa placed a collar before me.

"...What's this?"

"A collar. The sort used for dogs."\
"!? You... you wouldn't be suggesting that, Alyssa-sama...?"\
"Yes. I could wear it myself —it wouldn't be unpleasant, but that's not the point. I think we should use something visible like this as the signal."

For a moment, I genuinely considered whether she might actually wear it. And the fact she said it 'wouldn't be unpleasant' showed just how bold Alyssa was being —but I deliberately avoided pressing that point and continued the conversation.

"So, what's the alternative?"\
"I thought a choker would be good."

So, it seemed it was still going to be something worn around the neck after all.

"Why a choker?"\
"...It's rather like a collar, isn't it?"\
"That's what you settled on!?"\
"It's fine, isn't it? Wearing an actual dog collar as it is —well, that would be rather problematic in various ways."

I knew that without being told, and having it used as a signal would be troublesome.

"...I understand the choker is the signal. So, where do we get the choker?"\
"We're going to choose it now. Together."\
"I see —with me!?"

Lotte couldn't help but gasp in surprise.

"Is it really that surprising?"\
"W-well, yes. I mean, shopping with Lady Alisha..."

　—Since it concerns their secret agreement, it meant they would be going out together.\
Whether aware of Lotte's thoughts or not, Alisha offered a mischievous smile.

"In short, let's go on a date."\
"...W-w-what? A date!?"

Lotte's face flushed instantly.\
A date with Alisha —just imagining it felt like a dream.\
　After all, for Lotte, Alisha remained the object of her admiration.

"It's hardly something to be so surprised about. So, I want you to choose the choker."\
"M-me choose it...?"\
"Our secret pact —that's why I want you to choose it. Can you do that for me?"\
"I-if Lady Alisha says so... B-but, a date —do we have time to go out?"\
"Heh heh, don't underestimate me. Didn't I just go on an expedition recently? I haven't had much rest lately, so I've been granted some time off."

I certainly hope she takes that time off, but should Lotte really be using such precious leave...?

"I-I'm afraid to say, it's such a rare day off, but are you sure it's alright to spend it with someone like me?"\
"Huh? What are you talking about? I'm not asking you to do me a favour. Besides, this is necessary. I was thinking of going out tomorrow, but are you free?"\
"Y-yes. I'm free."\
"Then, let's arrange it that way."

—And so, Lotte ended up going out with Alisha.\
Alisha seemed perfectly calm about it, but that night —Lotte found herself facing a sleepless night.
