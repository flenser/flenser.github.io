"Hurry, we must untie them quickly...!"

It was Alisha who spoke in a flustered voice —Lotte snapped back to her senses and had Alisha put on the robe she had removed when binding her arms earlier.\
She then pulled the hood over Alisha's head and had her keep her head bowed.\
　Lotte stood beside her, and the source of the footsteps came into view.\
They glanced this way for a moment —but paid them no particular mind, passing right in front of the pair.\
After a while, Lotte let out a long breath.

"Well, I did think we might be found out..."

　Only now did it dawn on her —just how dangerous that had been.\
Not just the act itself, but if anyone had witnessed Alisha with her arms bound —who knew what rumours might spread?\
There’d be no excuse for it.\
Alisha, too, visibly relaxed, her expression easing.

"...Well, doing this outside really is dangerous. I’ll untie you right away—"\
"Wait."

When Lotte tried to untie the ropes, Alisha stopped her with those words.

"Why don't we just go home like this today?"\
"...W-What are you talking about!?"

Lotte let out a loud cry without meaning to, then looked around in alarm.\
There was no sign of anyone approaching. Once she calmed down, she spoke again in a low voice.

"What on earth are you saying...! It's far too dangerous, no matter how you look at it! What if we get caught...!?"\
"Isn't that thrill of possibly getting caught part of the fun?"

—What a dangerous way of thinking, Lotte couldn't help but feel dumbfounded.\
And yet, she was the one going along with it.\
Alisha actually started walking, still bound with her hands behind her back.

"A-Alisha —Alice! S-Stop, please!"\
"I'm fine."\
"What do you mean you're fine!? I'm telling you it'll be disastrous if we're caught!"\
"So, you'll protect me so we don't get caught? Like you did earlier?"

Leaving it all to someone else like that —Lotte desperately tried to stop her, but Alisha emerged from the alleyway.\
Having come out into public, making a scene here would only draw more attention.\
　Still tense, Lotte walked alongside Alisha.\
As for Alisha, she seemed somehow composed, even relaxed.\
Just moments ago, she'd been cornered and berated by Lotte —now the tables seemed to have turned.\
True, the robe she wore hid her bound hands.\
It was precisely her confidence that made it seem natural.\
　If she just went straight back now —would it be safe?\
Just as Lotte began pondering this, Alisha drifted over to yet another stall.\
This time it seemed to be a dessert stand offering fruit topped with cream and such, but of all things, Alisha addressed the stallholder.

"Any recommendations?"\
"Welcome. They're all popular, but my recommendation is—"

　Lotte was beside herself with worry —having spoken to her, she couldn't very well stop her now, and could only watch their conversation unfold with a knot of anxiety in her stomach.\
Just when she thought they'd finally finished talking, Alisha went and ordered something.\
She'd had a bad feeling about this, and sure enough, Alisha couldn't possibly carry it herself.\
So, Lotte ended up taking it for her.

"What on earth are you thinking, buying something in this situation...!?"

Keeping her voice low, Lotte spoke to Alisha in a slightly angry tone.\
But Alisha showed no sign of remorse,

"Since I can't eat it myself, will you feed it to me?"

She asked like it was the most natural thing in the world.\
What kind of obvious statement was that —her hands were tied behind her back, of course she couldn't eat.\
　Therefore, Lotte had no choice but to feed her.\
A mischievous thought flashed through her mind – perhaps she should just eat the entire thing right in front of her.

"...W-here you go."

Nevertheless, Lotte ended up feeding the dessert to Alisha.

"Mmm, sweet and delicious. Why don't you try some, Lotte?"\
"I don't really have much of an appetite right now..."

Lotte was honestly in no state for such things.

"Oh? Well then, I shan't hesitate... Open wide..."

As for Alisha, she showed no sign of caring, opening her mouth like a fledgling begging for food.\
Lotte tried to feed her again, but her hands trembled with nervousness, and she ended up pressing it against Alisha's cheek.

"Ah, I-I'm terribly sorry!"

Lotte apologised immediately, but Alisha just gave a soft chuckle.

"No need to apologise. More importantly, could you wipe this off?"

How could she be so calm about it —when she was the one struggling so much?\
Even that thought made Lotte frown slightly as she wiped Alisha's face.\
　In the end —they managed to return to the mansion without being spotted. But Alisha suggested they go back through the back door and slip straight back to her room without being seen.\
Was she just craving thrills no matter what? Ignoring Lotte's protests, she started walking again, leaving Lotte feeling utterly uneasy.
