Seeing Alisha injured, Lotte could not suppress her emotions.\
—Alisha's injury must surely be Lotte's responsibility.\
It might be arrogant to think so —but pushing Alisha away must have affected her mental state, at the very least.\
That result led to her injury.\
　She didn't mind being treated coldly —but she wanted to stop Alisha, who was trying to return to the front lines while still injured.

"—So, because the Flesis family were about to discover my relationship with Lotte, you pushed me away to make it all disappear?"\
"...Yes."

Lotte nodded slightly and continued.

"Regarding Lady Alisha's secret, it had to be kept hidden at all costs. So, if I severed all ties and resigned as maid, then—"\
"And that would solve everything?"

Interrupting Lotte, Alisha declared with a slightly angry expression.\
She couldn't answer —what she'd done thinking of Alisha's best interests had ultimately ended up hurting her both mentally and physically.\
　But—Alisha gently took Lotte's hand.

"! My lady Alisha...?"\
"You should have consulted me from the start."\
"W-well..."\
"Did you think I'd say it was fine if our relationship was discovered? True —I'd rather we be discovered than lose you. I believe I've reached that point."

　Alisha's words seemed sincere —which was precisely why Lotte couldn't tell her the truth.\
Pushing her away was the only way to protect Alyshia's 'present'.

"I'm truly grateful you acted for my sake. But tell me —if I did have a special relationship with you, what exactly is the problem?"\
"...Eh?"

　Lotte let out a flustered gasp at Alisha's question.

"Of course there would be a problem!"\
"Specifically?"\
"I'm just a lowly maid. For someone like me to have a... special relationship with Lady Alisha—"

Too presumptuous?\
Beyond my station?\
Uncertain which word fit, Lotte stumbled over her words.

"You needn't fear anything just because our relationship might be discovered."

Gently drawing Lotte closer, Alisha continued.

"Or is it that you dislike the idea of it becoming known —that I'm in a special relationship with you?"\
"If it were discovered, Lady Alisha's position would—"\
"Don't think about my position. I want to hear your honest feelings. Even if it were discovered —I wouldn't want to deny the days we spent together. Is that not the case for you, Lotte?"

Asked by Alisha, Lotte shook her head slightly.

"...For me too, the days I could be with you, Alisha-sama, were irreplaceable."\
"Then I want you to stay by my side from now on. Don't suffer alone —if anything happens, rely on me, alright?"

—Why is she speaking such gentle words to me?\
She should be hurt because of Lotte, yet Alisha is far too kind to her.\
To take advantage of that kindness —is it really permissible?

"...I betrayed your trust, Princess Alisha. It is utterly unforgivable."\
"It's alright. Because I've forgiven you."\
"But—"\
"Lotte."

Lotte found herself facing Alisha.\
Alisha wore a slightly troubled expression.

"What must I do for you to stay by my side?"

　—Lotte was about to make another mistake.\
She had become a maid to fulfil Alisha's wish.\
And yet —once more, she was about to ignore her words.\
Lotte's answer was decided —she met Alisha's gaze directly and replied.

"Miss Alisha —no, if Alice says she forgives me, then I shall remain by your side."\
"Of course I forgive you. After all, we're friends, aren't we?"

Alisha smiled, and finally —Lotte returned it with a small smile of her own.\
The relationship between the two, which should have been broken, was safely mended.
