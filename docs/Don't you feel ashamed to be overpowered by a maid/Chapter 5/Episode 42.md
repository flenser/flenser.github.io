I asked the innkeeper for some rope and secured it near the head of the bed.

"Does it hurt?"\
"Not at all. I suppose I'm getting used to being tied up."

Alisha said this with a hint of jest.\
Lotte couldn't help but let out a dry laugh.\
　There she lay, clad only in her undergarments, bandages wrapped around various places —bound, yet wearing an expression that hinted at a little anticipation.

"Right then, let's continue."

Lotte once more dampened the cloth and held it in her hand.\
Picking up where she left off —she pressed the cloth against the area around her armpit.

"Huh, uh..."

The ropes creaked with a sharp, grating sound.\
　She ought to be too weak to endure even a moment, but bound as she was, she had no choice but to endure.\
When her sensitive spots were touched, the rope's sound grew louder, making it clear.

"Hah, hah, fuh—"

Alisha's breathing grew ragged.\
It was hardly surprising, forced to endure unbearable stimulation.\
This might truly become too much of a burden —Lotte moved to wipe another area.

"W-wait."

It was Alisha herself who stopped her.

"Just a little longer, please."

Being touched near her armpits should be painful, yet Alisha specifically asked for it to continue.

"You dislike ticklish sensations, don't you? And yet, you want me to continue?"\
"......"

Alisha didn't answer immediately.\
Lotte touched near her armpit again.

"Mmm..."

Just a gentle touch elicited this reaction, yet she wished for it to continue? What did that mean?

"You're so sensitive, yet you want me to touch you?"\
"...I dislike it and I'm sensitive —but I don't mind when Lotte touches me."

With Alisha saying that, Lotte couldn't refuse.

"...I realised while touching you earlier, this area is particularly sensitive, isn't it?"

　Lotte said this while stroking the hollow near her armpit.

"Mmm, hmph, uhh..."

The reaction was stronger than before, making it abundantly clear Lotte had been right.

"Even though you're injured, you want to be tied up... deliberately asking for your weak spots to be touched... Alice, you really are hopeless, aren't you?"\
"...!"

　Lotte's words were clearly meant to berate Alisha.\
Yet, hearing them —Alisha felt aroused.\
She really was hopeless —despite being injured, was this what she desired?

"You wouldn't show this side of yourself to anyone else, would you?"

It was supposed to be just a matter of having her body wiped, yet she ended up asking for this.\
　Lotte couldn't afford to take too long, so she properly dried Alisha's body.\
Even after being dried, sweat beaded on her forehead —leaving her looking quite dishevelled.\
Being bound in her undergarments likely made it seem even more provocative.\
Once she regained her composure —why had drying her body led to this?\
　Though she should have untied her immediately once finished, Lotte, seeing Alisha like this, offered a small smile and said.

"It occurred to me... if she reacts like that just from being wiped... what would happen if I touched her directly?"\
"Huh!? W-wait, hold on!"

Alisha instantly looked flustered.\
Yet, only the creaking of the ropes could be heard —naturally, she couldn't get up.\
　Judging by how genuinely flustered she looked, even being touched by the cloth must have been quite intense.\
Ignoring Alisha's words, Lotte gently placed her hand near her armpit.

"Mmmph, ugh!?"

Alisha flinched violently.\
Lotte touched her skin with a gentle, stroking motion, as if digging her nails in, yet taking care never to draw blood.

"Really, no... please..."

The creaking of the ropes sounded louder than before.\
She seemed terribly weak, desperately trying to escape.\
But bound as she was, escape was impossible.

"This is what happens when you ask to be tied up."

Lotte slid the pads of her fingers from under her armpit towards her side.

"Ah, no, h-hmmph!"

Lotte chuckled softly at Alisha's uncharacteristic reaction.

"Even though it's just tickling, you can't bear it at all, can you, Alice?"\
"Bu-but... hmph!"\
"I thought it was just child's play... I'd like to see you show a little restraint."

　As if responding to Lotte's words, Alisha abruptly closed her mouth —showing an attempt to endure.\
But when Lotte stroked the hollow of her side with her nails, she immediately let out a breath.

"Pfft, ahaha, I, I can't take it anymore!"

Alisha burst out laughing, her resistance growing even more intense than before.

"But you did say you wanted me to touch you, didn't you?"\
"Directly? Hee hee! I didn't say that!"

She seemed quite flustered —her voice had grown considerably louder.\
It was so loud it might carry outside, so Lotte stopped her fingers abruptly.

"Hah, hah, hah..."

Alisha was panting so hard her shoulders were heaving.\
　Even though it was just tickling —somehow, her appearance seemed lewd.\
Lotte found herself holding her breath.

"...Alice."\
"...Lotte."

They called each other's names, and before they knew it —Lotte drew her face closer to Alisha's.\
They were now close enough to kiss —just then—

"Lady Alisha, are you there?"

A knock at the door sent both of them into a panic.\
Being seen like this —arms bound, confined to the bed in just her undergarments —would be the end of them.\
Lotte tried to reply, but the suddenness left her speechless.

"—I, I'm getting dressed right now! Could you wait a moment...!?"

　Though flustered, Alisha quickly thought on her feet.

"In that case, as this is urgent news, I shall relay the contents here. Lady Ellenphia, who led the expeditionary force in Lady Alisha's stead, has suffered defeat."\
"――!"

The atmosphere in the room changed instantly.
