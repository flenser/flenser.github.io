Ellenphia took Alisha's place and led the unit —only to suffer defeat at the hands of the monsters.\
This meant the Kingdom Knights had suffered their second defeat.\
Worse still, Ellenphia had fled, abandoning her comrades.\
The situation was worse than before —Alisha, whose injuries were not yet fully healed, was forced to go to their aid once more.

"...Even though her injuries haven't healed yet."

Helping Alisha change into her knight's formal attire, Lotte murmured softly.

"If the Saint were here, it might have been a little easier."

The Saint —so called because they wield magic capable of healing human wounds —were a precious existence, belonging to no single nation.\
　Lotte couldn't heal Alisha's wounds herself —all she could do was pray for her safety.\
It was utterly frustrating—but she couldn't stop her.\
Lotte understood why Alisha had to go.

"It'll be fine."

Alisha said this, touching Lotte's cheek with her hand.

"Alice...?"\
"Right now, I won't lose to anyone."

Alisha declared it with a face brimming with confidence.\
It wasn't bravado —Lotte could sense she truly meant it, with genuine conviction.

"...Yes. I believe in you, Alice."

That was all Lotte could do.\
　Alisha finished changing and left the room.\
The gentle atmosphere of moments before had vanished; she was now Alisha the knight.\
Lotte followed behind.\
—Many knights were stationed at the camp.\
But with numerous wounded, the atmosphere was quite hectic.

"How many are fit for battle?"\
"As things stand, not even half the number who arrived here."

　A knight answered Alisha's question.\
Less than half —that single statement alone conveyed to Lotte that the situation was even more dire than the initial battle.\
The monster's true form was that of a 'dragon'.\
While large among monsters, the size of the dragon confirmed within the kingdom this time was said to be only medium-sized.\
Yet its strength was genuine; Alisha had already suffered defeat once.\
　Moreover, considering Alisha had been holding the rear guard to allow her comrades to escape —it was nothing short of a miracle she had survived.\
Faced with such a formidable foe, most would lose heart.\
Stories of nations unable to defeat dragons, turning to other countries for aid —only to ultimately lose their lands —were not uncommon.\
That was precisely why this was also a battle to defend the kingdom.\
　Two defeats —a third cannot be permitted.\
No matter how dire the situation, Alisha absolutely must prevail.\
Indeed, the morale at the encampment changed markedly before and after Alisha's arrival.\
Until just after she arrived, everyone seemed to have lost hope. But upon hearing that Alisha would lead the charge once more, many began actively tending to the wounded and preparing for departure.\
　Such is the stature of Alisha within the Kingdom's Knights.\
One tent in the camp was reserved for Alisha, and Lotte was to stay there too.\
Alisha was already clad in armour, a sword slung at her waist.\
Ready to depart at any moment —Alisha suddenly spoke.

"Lotte."\
"H-huh! Yes, what is it?"\
"Once the dragon is slain, I'd like you to grant me one favour."\
"O-of course. I'll grant any favour."

Lotte answered instantly.\
Under normal circumstances, she might not have responded so quickly —but this too was something Lotte could do now.

"I'd like you to go a little further than usual."\
"...Further than usual, you say?"

She found herself repeating the words.\
After all —she'd already gone far enough before.\
What more could she possibly do?\
As Lotte pondered, Alisha drew closer.

"...And there's one more thing I'd like you to do before the slaying."\
"Huh!? Anything I can do for you!"\
"I'd like you to kiss me."\
"Understood —Huh?"

Just as she was about to answer immediately, Lotte let out a flustered gasp.

"A, a kiss... Eh!? A kiss!?"\
"D-Don't make me say it again."\
"S-s-sorry! But, um, why...?"\
"Remember when we spoke of the brothel? Since then... well, I've been curious."\
"I-I see...?"

Curious, so she wants to do it —a request no different from any other.\
Lotte nodded, forcing herself to accept it as inevitable.

"Well... is it really appropriate to do such a thing before going into battle..."

Lotte couldn't understand it, but surely now was precisely the time to focus.\
　A kiss... Was this really the right moment?

"It's precisely because we're about to go into battle that I want to. I... realised something after we parted on bad terms."

Saying this, Alisha gently drew Lotte closer.

"A-Alice...?"\
"I think I depend on you. Don't you think it's stupid that I only realised after you were gone?"\
"—"

　Alisha, the object of everyone's admiration, the 'perfect princess knight' —she was dependent on Lotte, a mere maid.\
Hearing such a confession, Lotte felt an indescribable sensation.\
Lotte gently stroked Alisha's hair.

"...You've become someone who can't manage without me, haven't you?"

When Lotte said this, Alisha gave a small nod.\
　Hearing this, Alisha's straightforward admission made her all the more endearing —Lotte faced Alisha and pressed her lips to hers.\
It was the first time in her life, and she didn't know if she could do it well —or even if she had done it well.\
Nearby, hurried voices reached her ears, preparing for the dragon hunt.\
But it didn't matter —this moment belonged only to the two of them.\
　Slowly parting their lips, Alisha spoke with a slightly elated expression.

"We're about to march into battle. If we're discovered, it truly would be the end of us as knights."

When Lotte pointed this out, Alisha replied, looking rather pleased.

"If we are discovered, we could just go somewhere where no one knows us."\
"...The knight I admired, Lady Alisha, would absolutely never do such a thing."\
"I'm Alice now, aren't I? But —yes. I wouldn't do that."

Alisha would never abandon everything and run away.

"—Let's leave this until after we've slain the dragon."\
"! Are you putting me off?"\
"Didn't you say it, Alice? Requests before battle are settled with a kiss. We'll get to the more intimate part afterwards, right?"\
"Does that mean I can look forward to it?"\
"Huh?! I-I don't know! Anyway, if you want me to hurry up —you absolutely must come back, alright?"

Taking Lotte's words to heart, Alisha answered with a determined expression.

"Of course —I'll defeat it swiftly and return."

Alisha led her troops —heading towards the battlefield.
