Approximately two months had passed since the dragon's defeat.\
Alishia had further enhanced her reputation as a knight and was busier than ever.\
Her injuries had fully healed, much to Lotte's relief.\
Lotte remained at the Zekrosia residence, still serving as a maid.

"—By the way, about that personal maid position... what do you think now?"

Alishia, having returned to her room in the mansion, suddenly voiced this thought.\
It felt like a rather nostalgic topic.\
Lotte answered while tidying Alishia's room.

"I have no intention of becoming your personal maid."\
"...Why not?"\
"If Alice and I become too intimate, well, people might start to suspect things."

—This stemmed from her past experiences being threatened by Ellenphia and Cortier.\
For now, no one had made contact again —she was being more cautious than before.\
Honestly, what they did when alone had become even more extreme.

"I believe it's important to show others that we maintain a standard distance —that of master and servant."\
"Hmm... Standard, eh?"

Alishia said this as she drew closer to Lotte.

"Wh-what is it...?"\
"Lotte and I aren't maintaining a standard distance, are we?"\
"Th-that's why I said it's important to appear that way in public!"\
"I'd rather emphasise how much closer Lotte and I actually are."

　Alyssa said with a slightly sulky expression.

"Absolutely not! My relationship with Alice is... well, a secret."\
"Then you don't need to hide it when we're alone."

Alishia said, wrapping her arm around Lotte's.\
Acting like a troublesome lover —Lotte let out a small sigh.

"I'm working, so please don't interrupt me."\
"Huh?! Why are you being so cold...?"\
"I'm not being cold. It's just the truth. And why are you still wearing that armour!"

Just as she said that, Lotte's eyes widened in surprise.\
Beneath her armour, Alisha's body was bound in ropes.\
Immediately, Lotte frantically scanned her surroundings.\
　—No one was watching from outside the window.\
Relieved, she turned back to admonish Alisha.

"...If anyone finds out you're doing this, all the reputation I worked so hard to build for you will be ruined."\
"Will you take responsibility then?"

—Why would the conversation turn to Lotte taking responsibility?\
The reason was simple —because Lotte was the one who had actually tied Alisha up.\
　Moreover, she had cooperated because Alisha wanted to try it out, inspired by knowledge gained from books.\
And why, of all things, did she choose to do it in full knight's attire? Because it heightened the sense of transgression.\
The fact that Lotte had agreed to such a reason suggested she, too, had become rather unusual.\
If Alisha were to say Lotte was responsible for leaving her tied up because she'd heard Alisha would untie herself, Lotte couldn't deny it.\
　She never imagined Alisha would actually go out with her body bound in ropes.\
Perhaps she should retract her claim that she was paying attention.\
As ever, Alisha seemed to be relishing the thrill.

"...I think this responsibility is far too great."\
"Yes, it is a great responsibility. Lotte will grant my wish, won't you?"

Alisha's attitude suggested she considered it the most natural thing in the world.\
　Lotte let out a small sigh but answered her question.

"Yes —fulfilling your wishes is my job."\
Lotte answered thus, her expression one of exasperation, and Alisha smiled.\
Lotte took Alisha's scarred right hand in hers —their secret relationship, shared only between them, would continue.
