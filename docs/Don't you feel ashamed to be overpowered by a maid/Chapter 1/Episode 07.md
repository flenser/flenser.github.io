Night —at a certain brothel in the royal capital.\
Even when most people are asleep, figures can still be seen in these parts.\
This is especially true for those who frequent brothels, as they often arrive late after drinking in taverns.\
On this day too, the brothel operated as usual.\
Such establishments, which might at first glance seem to threaten public decency, are not regulated under the kingdom's laws.\
　They are recognised as legitimate establishments for certain forms of entertainment —provided, of course, that only lawful activities are conducted within them.

"Wh-what...?"

Those near the brothel sensed something amiss.\
It was hardly surprising, given that several knights —fully armed —had appeared.\
Too many for a routine patrol, they were heading straight for the brothel.\
　Leading the way was —Alisha.

"I shall proceed ahead."

With those words —Alisha broke into a run.\
Guards hired by the brothel were visible.\
Such establishments likely saw their share of disputes with patrons.\
When Alisha reached the entrance, they stood in her path as expected.

"Can I help you?"\
"This is no place for someone like you."

Both men addressed her with similar words.\
They weren't wrong —this was no place for Alisha to be.\
However, it was only a place she wouldn't visit privately.\
For work —that was a different matter.

"I need to see the manager. Will you let me through?"\
"We cannot admit you without an appointment. Please leave."\
"I'm afraid I'll have to enter without one. I possess the right to do so."\
"Then —we shall have to stop you by force."

One of the men reached out towards Alisha.

"—"

In an instant, the man flew through the air.\
The burly man had been tossed aside with ease.\
　It was a physical technique combined with magic —one of Alisha's specialised combat arts.\
Physical disparity meant nothing to her; men of this calibre could not stop Alisha.

"You —Gah!?"

The other man didn't even draw his sword. She closed the distance, striking his abdomen with the hilt —a single blow sent him sprawling face-first.\
　Having dispatched the two gatekeepers with ease, Alisha pressed straight on towards the inner chambers of the brothel.

"Wh-what's happening —wait, Lady Alisha!?"

A man who had likely arrived as a customer cried out in surprise upon seeing her.\
She had no business with the patrons here —intelligence had reached her that the woman running this establishment was secretly dealing in 'magic herbs', substances prohibited within the kingdom.\
　Naturally, mere information wouldn't prompt immediate action —but verification of this tip had already been secured.\
While Alisha led the way, her fellow knights deployed to encircle the building.\
Even if they'd been alerted, this would prevent any escape from the premises.\
As Alisha advanced further into the depths, a woman's voice could be heard from within a room.

(...From this room, then.)

The inner chamber was restricted to authorised personnel only; the woman they sought was likely confined here.\
Alisha touched the hilt of the sword at her waist, then kicked the door open with forceful momentum, bursting inside.

"Don't move! If you resist, I won't be gentle—"\
"Mmm, haa, ah..."

Alisha's words were cut off by a woman's sultry voice.\
Ignoring Alisha's sudden entrance, two women were embracing on the bed.\
　Semi-naked, moreover —clearly enjoying activities far from wholesome.\
Having barged into a brothel, Alisha understood intellectually that such unwholesome activities might occur.\
Yet two women embracing each other —even Alisha couldn't comprehend this situation, freezing in place.\
Finally, one of the women addressed the sudden intruder.

"Why, if it isn't our lovely Princess Knight? Might we ask what brings you here?"

They seemed remarkably composed —indeed, these two women were not the person Alisha was pursuing.\
Their presence in this room suggested they might be involved, yet they showed no signs of resistance or flight.\
Rather, they continued their improper activities in full view of Alisha.\
Her gaze was drawn to their actions.

"Could it be, Princess Knight, that you take an interest in such matters?"

The other woman chuckled softly as she spoke.\
Alisha snapped back to her senses and forced herself to continue calmly.

"Ah, well, I... I came here pursuing the woman who runs this establishment..."\
"Ah, that one? She's probably already made her escape through the back by now, hasn't she?"

　Judging by her absence here, it seemed she had indeed noticed the Knights' movements.\
Seeing that the women hadn't fled, perhaps they worked at this brothel or assisted in its management —it wasn't clear, but they displayed a remarkably composed demeanour.

"If you're going to chase her, now would be the time, but you don't have business with us, do you?"\
"Y-yes."

Asked so directly, Alisha found herself answering honestly.\
　Not that she had no business here; she might be questioned about the circumstances later.\
But her sole objective now was the female proprietor.\
The scene before her was too shocking for Alisha—she found herself slipping into formal speech.\
Indeed, the fact they continued their actions even after Alisha arrived —should one commend their nerve?
　Two women, half-naked, engaged in an unwholesome act —Alisha found herself gasping at the sight.\
The moment the two women realised Alisha had no business with them, they showed no concern for her presence.\
Rather, they seemed to be flaunting it —shooting her fleeting glances.\
Or perhaps they were enjoying her reaction.\
　This was the first time Alisha had stumbled upon such a scene —had the women stopped immediately upon seeing her surprise, she might not have cared.\
But precisely because it piqued her interest, she found herself trying to comprehend the act unfolding before her, lacking any prior knowledge.\
—Alisha had lived her life honing her skills as a knight.\
Her mastery of swordsmanship was such that few could rival her, some even claiming she had no equal.\
　Even the men employed in this brothel might not have been easily defeated by a knight of lesser skill.\
In a sense —Alisha was excellent as a knight, but she possessed no knowledge of anything else.\
That was precisely why this unknown world had struck such a powerful chord within her.\
Despite the urgent need to pursue them, Alisha found herself unable to move.

"Lady Alisha!"

The sudden sound of her name being called made Alisha's body tremble violently.

"Report that the woman who was trying to escape through the back door has been captured!"\
"What?! I'll be right there!"

Before her fellow knights could reach her, Alisha replied and dashed away from the spot as if fleeing.\
　—As if to shake off the fact she’d been captivated by the scene just now.\
In the end —they succeeded in apprehending the proprietress, but I hear the establishment itself continues to operate without issue under new management.\
Presumably, the women who were present took over.\
Regardless —brothels are places far removed from Alisha’s world.\
　While she might enter one for work, she would never set foot in one privately.\
And precisely because it was something she would never do —that day was etched deep into the recesses of Alisha's memory.
