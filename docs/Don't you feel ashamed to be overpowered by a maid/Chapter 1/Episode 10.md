"My apologies for the sudden intrusion. I came to enquire about the bandits who raided this village earlier."\
"Ah, well... y-yes, I'm aware. The bandits...?"\
"We've already taken custody of them. However, we'd also like to speak with those who assisted in capturing them. We heard information that someone entered this shop earlier."

　—Even in a sparsely populated village, such a conspicuous event couldn't go unnoticed.\
It was only natural to assume someone had seen Alisha enter this shop too.

"They... they came to collect a book they bought here."

Lotte answered honestly, though her gaze darted around.

"And afterwards?"\
"After receiving it... I don't know."

Lotte lied—because she was still inside, after all.\
The knight woman glanced towards the back of the shop.\
Lotte was terrible at lying — but since Alisha had asked her, she had no choice but to try.

"You didn't know that person?"\
"Eh!? No, I didn't know them. They had their face covered too..."\
"Did you hear their voice?"\
"They didn't speak."

Capturing a thief and then vanishing without a word — clearly a suspicious character.\
After hearing Lotte's explanation, the knight sighed softly.

"—I see. Thank you for your assistance. Should you learn anything further, please contact the Knights' Order."\
"Ah, well... what would you do if you discovered that person's identity?"

Lotte asked, just to be sure, about what was on her mind.

"Nothing at all. I'd simply wish to express my gratitude for your assistance in capturing the thief. That's all. In such cases, a reward is usually offered... but perhaps you're not interested in that sort of thing."

　The knight replied thus, then turned and walked away.\
—Of course, Alisha hadn't done anything wrong.\
It was simply that they didn't want anyone to know she was here.\
Having dealt with that, Lotte returned to Alisha.

"How did it go?"\
"Nothing much, she simply left."\
"Oh? That's good... Since I'm here concealing my knightly status, it would have been rather troublesome if discovered – all the paperwork and such."\
"I-Is that so?"\
"Indeed. We'd have to explain why she was in that situation to begin with, and various other things. She might even have had to declare the items she purchased."

When it came to items purchased here – her gaze inevitably fell upon the book on the table.

"Honestly, it pained me to tell a lie..."

Lotte murmured involuntarily.\
—Alisha hadn't done anything wrong, and the knight lady just wanted to express her thanks.\
Yet somehow, Lotte ended up having to lie. Why was that?

"Lotte, you're such a good girl."\
"Huh?! Wh-what's this all of a sudden?"\
"No, I just thought it honestly. I'm sorry I made you lie because of me."\
"It's nothing for Lady Alisha to apologise for...! I-I understand the circumstances, you see."\
"...I suppose so. Lotte, you've discovered my secret, haven't you?"

Suddenly, an uneasy atmosphere emanated from Alisha.\
　Indeed, Lotte had learned Alisha's secret.

"Of course, I won't tell anyone!"\
"I'd be grateful if you didn't... but there's one more thing I'd like to ask of you."\
"A request? If it's something I can do..."

Lotte answered casually, without a second thought.

"I'm glad to hear you say that. Truth be told... I wanted someone I could trust — someone to share my secret with."

Suddenly, Alisha flashed a somewhat suggestive smile, causing Lotte to gasp involuntarily.

"...Er, what exactly do you mean?"\
"My request is this — would you become my personal maid?"\
"...Eh?"

　For Lotte, Alisha's request was utterly unexpected.\
To be precise, it was a perfectly ordinary request—but for Lotte, it was nothing short of shocking.

"Personal... maid...!?"\
"Yes, would you be my personal maid?"

My personal maid — hence 'personal'.\
Faced with this sudden request, Lotte could only feel bewildered.

"Wh-why me...!?"\
"I explained. I wanted someone to share my secret with."\
"Sh-sharing a secret... I won't tell anyone!"\
"Of course, I don't doubt you."\
"Then why..."

Could it mean she wanted someone close precisely because she doubted them?

"You originally worked for the Zekrosia household, didn't you? Was there a reason you left?"\
"That... isn't really worth explaining."

Lotte couldn't possibly tell Alisha herself that she'd left because she couldn't fit in with the others, so she concealed that truth.

"Then, how about working at our mansion again? If you don't mind, that is."

A direct invitation from Alisha herself – this was likely a turning point that would never come again in her life.\
　Yet, for Lotte, who had already left once, to return to the manor?\
It was not something she could answer immediately.\
Moreover, Alisha currently had no personal maid – meaning Lotte would become her one and only maid.\
For Lotte, it was an offer far too burdensome to bear.

"...Please give me some time to think."

—That was all Lotte could say.

　　　＊＊＊

Night — Lotte was recalling today's events.\
She never imagined she'd reunite with Alisha in such a way, let alone end up sharing a secret.

"...Why, I wonder?"

Lotte voiced this question.\
It was — a question directed at herself.\
Why hadn't she simply said, "It's impossible," and refused outright?\
The usual Lotte, even if asked to return as a maid again — would surely have refused immediately.\
After all, she'd quit because it wasn't a good fit.\
Yet she'd given an answer like "Let me think about it," making the other person wait.\
　When Alisha asked, she simply couldn't refuse — after all, it was someone she admired relying on her.

(Is that it?)

It was simple — Lotte still wanted to be useful to Alisha.\
That's why she cooperated when asked to keep her presence here secret, and why she asked for time to consider rather than outright refusing the request to become her personal maid.

"...But exclusive... exclusive, huh?"

It was clearly a position unbecoming of Lotte. What would happen if Alisha suddenly introduced Lotte as her exclusive maid at the mansion?\
　She didn't even want to imagine it — Lotte curled up small in the bed.\
What should she do? — As she agonised, she recalled her exchanges with Alisha.\
Honestly, the time spent with her had been happy.\
After all, she was willing to become a maid just to be useful to her—no matter what secrets she learned, Lotte's feelings wouldn't change.

"...Ah."

Lotte murmured softly, as if suddenly realising something.\
That's right — Lotte's feelings hadn't changed.\
—Then the answer was already decided.\
Lotte sat up, her expression filled with resolve — and turned her gaze to the view outside the window.
