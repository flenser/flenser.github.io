"Wh-what are you saying—"\
"It's pointless trying to hide it. You saw the letter I received and came straight here, didn't you?"

So the sender of the letter handed to her earlier was Cortier.\
The letter's contents demanded she come to a specified location, threatening to expose Alisha and Lotte's secret if she refused.\
Naturally, Lotte overreacted at the word 'secret'.\
　After all, it was something only the two of them should know.\
If it had been exposed — Lotte couldn't possibly ignore it.

"Th-that is—"

Lotte tried to cover it up, but the words wouldn't come.

"Rest assured. I have no intention of resorting to violence. Once more — would you be so kind as to visit the Flesis residence?"

Lotte had no choice but to comply with Cortier's request.\
　—And so, she found herself visiting the Flesis residence once more.\
She was led to the same garden as before, where Ellenphia awaited.

"Thank you for taking the trouble to come again."

Ellenphia spoke, a faint smile playing on her lips.\
It was an awfully insincere remark — Lotte felt uneasy as she took her seat.

"...This secret... what exactly are we talking about...?"

Lotte managed to ask Ellenphia.\
No — or rather, she managed to ask.\
Though caught off guard and losing her composure, what did Ellenphia know about the specific secret between Alisha and Lotte?

"Since you've gone to the trouble of following all this way, you must have a special relationship, right? I'll say it again, hiding it is pointless."

It was Cortier who answered Lotte's question.\
Her gaze was sharp, as if seeing through everything, and Lotte felt herself shrink.\
If she spoke carelessly, she might well be the one to slip up.\
It was undeniably true that they had a special relationship.\
　Whether the specifics were known was irrelevant now—the problem was that it was known that Alisha and Lotte shared a relationship unlike any ordinary one.

"Now then, to reiterate my proposal... Have you any intention of joining the Flesis household?"\
"...!?"

Lotte's expression turned to shock at Ellenfia's suggestion.\
　She hadn't expected such a request from Ellenphia at this stage.

"I... I believe I declined that previously."\
"Indeed. So the reason you cannot join the Flesis household is because you have some sort of special relationship with Alisha, is it?"\
"Wh-wh-why would you think that!? Alisha-sama and I are not in such a relationship!"

At last, she voiced a clear denial.

"You seem rather flustered, aren't you? Why not have a drink to calm yourself?"

Ellenphia said this, lifting the teacup before her to her lips.\
—She understood she was being threatened.\
Whatever the truth between Alisha and Lotte, they undoubtedly shared a special bond.\
Perhaps what they were doing together had truly been discovered.\
Was that why Ellenphia wore such a confident expression?

"You needn't reply immediately. But — you'd do well to consider your answer."

—Lotte couldn't even respond to Ellenphia's words.

＊＊＊

—How much time had passed?\
Lotte realised she had returned to the Zekrosia residence.\
　Told by another maid that Alisha was calling for her, she headed towards the room.\
Upon entering, Alisha, already wearing the choker around her neck, wore a slightly angry expression.

"Where were you? We agreed you'd come here once shopping was finished."

It was true they had agreed — but that was the least of her concerns now.

"...? Did something happen?"

Alisha seemed to have sensed something, asking with concern.\
How should she respond? Lotte hesitated.\
Perhaps their secret had been discovered.\
If she told Alisha, how would she react?\
Even then — would she still want to continue their current relationship?\
Surely, Alisha would say she'd find a solution.\
　—Given her nature, she most certainly would.\
Lotte was certain of this, and precisely because of that—she couldn't tell her.

(...What I can do to protect Lady Alisha)

—Her mouth felt dry.\
Was what she was about to do truly right? Lotte didn't know.\
But for Alisha's sake — Lotte clenched her fist tightly.\
　Lotte was terrible at lying — yet she resolved to deceive even her own feelings for the sake of someone precious.\
After a moment's silence, Lotte forced the words out.

"...Shall we stop this sort of thing?"\
"!"

Alisha's expression betrayed her surprise at Lotte's words.
