After Lotte and Alisha had departed — it was Cortier who appeared in the alleyway.\
Given Lotte's profound loyalty — Ellenphia and Cortier had concluded she was not the sort who could be bought, at least not with money.\
Summoning her had yielded no results — Ellenphia was disheartened, but Cortier immediately sprang into action.\
　She had observed that the two shared a special bond.\
For a moment, she nearly drew Alisha's attention and had to hide, but it seemed she managed to avoid detection.\
Though she couldn't hear their conversation, their interaction appeared remarkably intimate.\
Particularly the moment when Alisha deliberately asked Lotte to fasten the choker around her neck — there must be a reason for that.

"Quite a harvest, I'd say."

Muttering that under her breath, Cortier returned directly to the Flesis residence.\
Knowing Lotte hadn't gone far, Cortier acted immediately.\
What she found was Lotte and Alisha meeting secretly in a deserted spot.\
It wasn't unusual for a master and maid to be alone together.\
　However — moving deliberately to a spot out of sight is another matter entirely.

"I'm back."

Cortier appeared before Ellenphia, who was already resting in her room.

"My, you're back rather quickly. Did you uncover anything of interest?"\
"Indeed. To get straight to the point — Lotte and Lady Alisha appear to share a special relationship."

　Cortier stated it in a matter-of-fact tone.\
A special relationship — it was certainly sufficient as information obtained, yet Ellenphia's reaction was not particularly strong.

"A special relationship, eh? Well, it's good to know that, but does it lead to a weakness?"\
"A noble lady having a special relationship with a maid — that could certainly be scandalous enough."\
"But there's no proof, is there?　Even if someone were to spread it, a denial would be the end of that. From my perspective, it seems far from being a weakness."

Ellenphia's point was not wrong.\
Indeed — even if the two did have a special relationship, merely leaking this information somewhere would hardly cause a major problem.\
However, Cortier had an idea.

"There's no need to deliberately spread it. What's important is — the fact that we were able to obtain that information."

　Yes, she said, a small smile playing on her lips.

＊＊＊

Several days after being summoned to the Flesis residence — Lotte had gone out to run errands.\
She'd only ventured near the estate to buy daily necessities, and Alisha had told her to come to her room upon returning.\
This too had become routine for her, and she intended to return as soon as possible.\
　Just as she was beginning to forget the recruitment talk at the Flesis residence — a figure cloaked in robes stood beside Lotte.\
Clearly suspicious in appearance, Lotte instinctively took a step back.

"This way."\
"...?"

The robed figure drew a letter from their bosom and handed it to Lotte.\
　Then, they promptly departed.

"Ah, well — they've gone..."

What on earth was that? It had happened so suddenly she'd accepted it without thinking, but it was clearly a letter from a suspicious individual.\
She hesitated over whether to open it, but the addressee was Lotte.\
Meaning it hadn't been handed over by mistake — though the sender was unknown, Lotte cautiously decided to check the contents.

"——"

Reading the contents, Lotte's eyes widened in shock.\
Though she was mid-shopping, Lotte hurriedly exited the shop.\
The cloaked figure was already gone — but Lotte immediately began running.\
The location specified in the letter was a building not far from here — it seemed to be an abandoned house, unused by anyone. Resolving herself, Lotte entered.\
　The interior was quite dusty, seemingly neglected.

"—The fact that you came here confirms that you two share a special relationship, doesn't it?"\
"Huh!?"

A voice came from behind, and Lotte turned around.\
Standing there was — Cortier, the maid of the Flesis household.
