――Some time had passed since Lotte began working for the Zekrosia household.\
On this day, Alisha found herself in the square within the royal palace.\
A ceremony was being held there, attended by numerous knights and nobles – even members of the royal family were present.\
Once a year, an award ceremony was held to honour the knights who served the kingdom.\
　Indeed, being honoured within the palace walls was considered the knight's highest honour —and this year, Alisha was once again recognised for her achievements and awarded.\
Her swift extermination of monsters during expeditions was particularly noted, and she flawlessly executed every emergency mission without fail.\
Everyone present acknowledged it —she was truly the 'perfect princess knight'.\
Yet, amidst this universal acclaim for the heroine Alisha, one girl fixed her gaze upon her with a cold stare.

"...Why is it always that woman who receives praise!"

The girl clad in full knight's attire was named — Ellenphia Flesis.\
With her long, wavy hair gathered into two side -swept buns, she was the young lady of the prestigious noble house of Flesis, and like Alisha, a knight.\
That is to say, a princess knight — yet she had never once been honoured.\
It was not particularly unusual.\
　It wasn't because she was a noble that she received commendations —it was simply that Ellenphia hadn't distinguished herself.\
Therefore, she was entirely consumed by jealousy towards Alisha.\
She watched the commendation ceremony from a slightly distant, secluded spot, rather than among the assembled knights —her position afforded her that luxury.\
It also signified that, unlike Alisha, she hadn't become a knight through legitimate means.\
　However, asserting her position in this manner was also Ellenphia's way of demonstrating her status as a knight.\
Purely, she was just wielding her power.

"It is only natural that Lady Alisha should be praised."

Responding to Ellenphia's indignant words was a woman in the form of a maid standing behind her —Cortier Evans.\
　Having served the Flesis family for a considerable length of time, she was the only maid assigned exclusively to Ellenphia.\
Unlike Ellenphia, Alisha, though an aristocrat, did not flaunt her status, but had started as a lowly knight and worked her way up through honest effort.\
She was well-regarded by her colleagues, subordinates, and even her superiors.\
　Indeed, it wasn't just the knights —the people of the kingdom as a whole recognised Alisha's worth.\
In other words, she was simply being evaluated fairly, and it was Ellenphia who was unreasonable for not accepting that.

"You too, evaluating that woman!?"

Ellenphia shot a sharp glance at Cortier and spat out the words.\
　Naturally, if Ellenphia understood this, she wouldn't harbour jealousy towards Alisha.

"...Calm yourself. If others hear, it will only worsen your standing."

Cortier remarked in a low voice, as if pointing something out.\
Cortier was right —even Ellenphia seemed to grasp this, glancing around warily before muttering,

"... I too would be standing there if only I had the chance."

Yes, she muttered resentfully.\
Finding a place to shine —that too should be something one does for oneself, naturally.\
But from Ellenphia's perspective —despite holding the identical position of Princess Knight —the disparity in their evaluations was like heaven and earth.\
She was still only ever given tasks entrusted to lowly knights.\
　That was the current assessment of Ellenphia, and it was not wrong.\
But at this rate, she would never become like Alisha.\
No, it wasn't that she wanted to be like Alisha —she had to become someone who surpassed Alisha.\
To the very end —Ellenphia was arrogant.\
So naturally, her way of thinking became distorted.

"If only I could find that woman's weakness..."

Such foolish thoughts even crossed her mind.\
Had someone been nearby to dissuade her —perhaps Ellenphia could still have held back.

"Weakness, you say?"

But it was Cortier who responded.\
Cortier too —swore allegiance to Ellenphia.\
　She was prepared to push things a little further if it meant changing her master's position.\
Cortier glanced briefly at Alisha, who had just finished the award ceremony.\
Alisha headed towards the seats reserved for the nobles' attendants.\
She had often seen Alisha before.\
The usual Alisha would have returned to her seat immediately.\
　Observing her movements, he saw her conversing with a young girl there.\
At last year's ceremony, at the very least, she had not brought a maid.\
She was not one to flaunt authority; she stood here as a knight.\
Therefore, she would not have brought a maid.\
Perhaps she only started bringing one this year —that explanation might suffice, yet their conversation seemed oddly intimate.\
　Had something changed within her, or —was there someone who had brought about that change?\
Cortier fixed a sharp gaze upon the pair.

"Lady Ellenphia, perhaps —there may be a way."\
"Huh? What way?"\
"A way to gain leverage over Lady Alisha."

Cortier stated it matter-of-factly.
