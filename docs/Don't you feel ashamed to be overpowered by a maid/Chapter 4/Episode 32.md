The Flesis family mansion also stood within the royal capital.\
Its grounds were quite extensive; while perhaps not quite on par with the Zekrosia estate, they were likely comparable in scale.\
Among the nobility, the size of one's residence and the expanse of one's grounds likely served as indicators of authority.\
Within the beautifully manicured gardens —seated in a chair —Lotte faced Ellenphia.

"Do help yourself to drinks and sweets."

Ellenphia said this, gesturing towards the items laid out on the table.\
They were all likely luxury items —Alisha ate sweets too, but rarely saw ones so elaborately presented.\
Made by craftsmen, Lotte frankly needed courage to put them in her mouth.\
Her throat parched with nervousness, she at least brought the tea before her to her lips.

"I hear you serve as Alisha's maid?"

Suddenly, Ellenphia broached the subject thus.\
Lotte promptly set down her teacup and nodded.

"Y-yes. And the reason you summoned me...?"\
"Alisha doesn't usually keep maids by her side. She insists she's merely a knight... that seems to be the official line, at least. But today was different —you must be exceptionally capable, I suppose?"\
"N-no, not at all..."

Exceptional —she almost took it at face value, but even Lotte knew better.\
Unless there was some special reason, Alisha wouldn't summon her.

"I have many capable maids at my side. Cortier is one of them —but don't you think one can never have too many capable maids?"\
"...?"

Lotte frowned, unable to grasp what Ellenphia meant.\
She glanced briefly at Cortier, who stood waiting just behind her, but the girl showed no sign of intervening.

"In short, I am proposing to welcome you as a maid to the Flesis household."\
"...!? Me?!"

Lotte's eyes widened in astonishment at Ellenphia's words.\
In other words, poaching Lotte, a maid of the Zekrosia household —was such a thing even possible?

"It is not an uncommon occurrence. Such matters are frequently discussed amongst the nobility."

As if reading Lotte's thoughts, it was Cortier, who had been standing by, who answered her question.\
Perhaps she too had experienced such a thing —Ellenphia continued.

"If you would tell us the terms under which you are employed by the Zekrosia household, I promise we can offer you far more favourable conditions. So, would you not consider becoming my maid?"

　Indeed —if one had reasons such as financial hardship, accepting such an offer might be understandable.\
The Zekrosia household's terms were by no means poor, but if they were to be surpassed —for Lotte, employed as a lowly servant, it would undoubtedly be an exceptional offer.\
However, in Lotte's case, it was precisely because of Alisha that she worked for the Zekrosia household.\
There might be others like her, but for Lotte, she simply couldn't conceive of working anywhere else but under Alisha.

"W-well, it's a generous offer... um, I am truly grateful..."

Lotte showed her intention to decline.\
—That said, while trying to avoid being rude, she ended up stammering somewhat.

"Any conditions are acceptable, you know? We are prepared to welcome you on whatever terms you desire."

To be offered that much —it must be a fortunate thing.\
　Yet Lotte knew nothing of Ellenphia.\
Working under her simply because the terms were favourable —that was something Lotte could not do.\
Therefore, no matter what was said, her answer remained unchanged.

"...I'm terribly sorry."

Saying that, she could only bow her head.

"I see. That is a pity."

Should she call it unexpected? Ellenphia did not press the matter further.\
She offered sweets, made small talk, and then instructed Cortier to escort Lotte out.\
Honestly, despite refusing the offer to join her, Lotte felt even more apologetic at being treated so courteously.\
　She declined the offer of being escorted all the way out, but Cortier did see her to the mansion gates.

"Should you ever change your mind, please do come back. We shall be fully prepared to welcome you."\
"Ah, thank you."

Was saying thank you really the right thing to do? In the end, Lotte declined the Flesis family's recruitment offer and left.
