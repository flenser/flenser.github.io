"...This is a problem."\
"I suppose so. Without this magic wand, Serene can't fight."\
"Can't something be done?"\
"Impossible. Well, first I think you need to understand the basics."

The wandmaker pointed to her ample bosom.

"The raw material for that thing is a witch's heart—a Magus Engine.\
　Right now, it's completely shattered.\
Without a new heart, it can't be repaired."

She knew that.\
But she hadn't realised the situation was that dire.

"Well, its lifespan was probably coming to an end anyway. The raw material used in its creation —Jade Green— The Gemini Witch was in a terrible state when she was defeated."\
"...I... I did that..."\
"Mm. You smashed it to smithereens. How dare you show your face here, having completely killed your friend."

Sere faltered.

"...I'm not saying that.\
The moment you become a witch, your mind completely collapses.\
There's debate over whether you can still call it human, but I reckon once the M-particle magic turns black, you can treat it as dead.\
Otherwise...\
　You wouldn't be able to fight anymore, would you?"\
"...Thank you."\
"It's not kindness. It's confirming the facts."

The mask split in two, revealing a long tongue that seemed to say "oopsie daisy".\
It was the wandmaker's habit when trying to lighten the mood.

"—If I were truly kind, I wouldn't have made you fight in the first place, Serene."\
"Don't worry about that."\
"You're not a magical girl or anything. You're just a child forced to wield a magical weapon."\
"I'm past the age of being called a child, and I'm fighting of my own volition."

Her eyebrows twitched.\
Even without eyeballs, those eyes were far too expressive.

"...【Blue】."\
"Ah, big sis is dead."\
"At this age, there are far too many obituaries of acquaintances. Bloody hell...!"

Countless scissors clatter.\
The wandmaker licks his coffee.\
On the brink of losing his sanity, the wandmaker regains his reason.

"...But the staff won't be repaired. You may step down from the stage."\
"A Magus Engine would suffice, wouldn't it? I'll attack a magical girl instead."\
"Useless. To become a witch, you need an engine contaminated with M-particles. A magical girl's fresh, pristine engine won't generate enough output."\
"...Then..."\
"Yes."

The staffmaker told Sere.

"You have no choice but to kill one of your fellow witches."

Sere had already understood this at the end of her thoughts.

"...What about the queue?"\
"There's someone in this town who's been waiting for five years."\
"That's good."\
"…………[Emerald Green], no..."

　The staff maker faltered.\
However, there was little time left to remain sane.\
As if squeezing the words out, the eyeless girl with the monstrous arms declared.

"The Gemini Witch. Send er to her other half —her sister.\
I beg you, Raven Silver."
