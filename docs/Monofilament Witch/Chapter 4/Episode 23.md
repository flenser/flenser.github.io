【Serebryani Adamov】 thinks.\
Poor witches.\
Poor magical girls.\
And among them, the ultimate example —the 【Gemini Witches】.

【Gemini Witches】—【Green】 was a pair of magical girls.\
　The sisters Emerald Green and Jade Green.\
Emerald was the elder sister, Jade the younger.\
They were close sisters.\
Always together.

Because they only had one body.

"Ah, Blue. You came!"

With clouded eyes, Emerald Green... The remaining witch of Gemini welcomed Sere. Under the sky of Chiba City. On top of a pile of illegal buildings.\
The sunset illuminated her.

From the waist up, her torso was split into two.

One stylish skirt.\
Two green blouses.\
Four slender, beautiful arms.\
However —only the head on the right side remained. The other torso lay there like a headless mannequin, clothed but lifeless.

Only the right body waved.\
Only the right side bore the calmly smiling girl with short hair.\
With hair the colour of muddy black and green mingled together, the girl... the Gemini Witch welcomed Sere, who had climbed up the ladder.

"...It's me, Sere, Emerald-chan."\
"【Blue】. Hey, listen, listen? 【Jade】, you see! She's been... completely, utterly silent for ages!"

Sere forced a smile.\
The 【Gemini Witch】 looked troubled.

"She hasn't spoken to me for 2075 days, 13 hours, 14 minutes and 15 seconds!　Isn't that awful!? It's horrible, right!? Did I do something wrong!?"\
"...I see."\
"That's right! For ages and ages and ages and ages and ages! She won't forgive me even if I give her her favourite cat cheese, and she won't play card games with me either! Hey, Blue, Blue!"\
"What is it, Emerald?"\
"Please listen to Hisui... I'll wear headphones. I promise I won't really listen! Please? I beg you! Just this once!"

If 【Sapphire Blue】 had been here, she might have wryly remarked, "How many times have you made this 'once in a lifetime' plea?" But Sere hadn't cultivated that level of intimacy with her.\
She merely 【thought】.\
　And dismisses that 【Thought】 as unhealthy.\
Grotesque.\
To say she's beyond saving.

Someone had thought.\
'If there were two Heart Mage Engines, she'd be incredibly powerful.'\
Then, 'You'd need two brains to control it.'

M-particle weapons... The Fourth World War's final phase, where the arms race of 【Magic】 bred further arms races. Such research was conducted worldwide, yielding only one successful example in Japan.\
That was the 【Gemini Witch】.\
This is her end.\
The 【Gemini Witch】, having lost her twin, now fails to recognise the death of her lost half. The brain that would 【think】 this has deteriorated. She will likely never 【recall】 the fact of losing her twin until she dies, nor will she ever try to 【recall】 it.

　Her neck was severed by the magical girl Viola Purple.\
And her remaining heart was offered up to the Organisation.

"...Hey, Emerald."\
"Blue. Please. It's fine to fight with me, but if things stay like this, Jade... will be left all alone. That's no good. Absolutely no good."

Her sister Emerald Greer's voice was serious.\
　Sere understood that this was how it was.\
She had an older sister too. The world's best older sister, Sapphire Blue. That was precisely why she could instinctively understand that her sister's feelings for her younger sister were genuine.

"People can't live alone.\
Especially twisted and deformed ones like us."\
"...All right, Emerald. I'll listen to you."\
"Really?! Thank you! I'll definitely repay you!"\
"So then..."

Sere clutched her tools behind her back.

"...Could you sleep for a little while?"\
"Huh? Oh, yeah... You're right, it must be hard for Jade to talk with me here..."\
"Mm."\
"Got it!"

Her long lashes closed her eyes.\
　The wind in Chiba City's sky stroked her hair.\
Sere took a deep breath.

From now on, she would take the heart of this hopelessly innocent, pure, sisterly, yet utterly maddened elder sister.

Another night, another day. Another job, another run.\
That's how it was.

Her 【Thoughts】 were organised to a fault.\
　Yet she cannot help but think.\
Is this truly right?

Still uncertain, Sere approaches.\
At least, so it won't hurt.\
Thinking this, she takes the sleeping potion from her pocket to rob the witch of consciousness—

"Coming."

Eyes snap open, meeting emerald ones.

"'It is for peace. It is for tranquillity.\
　For order, I cast this and grant the power to wield it.\
Therefore. You bear no guilt.'"

The wind of Chiba City is dyed by a yellow phosphorescent glow.

"—Chiwawa Yellow! I'm back, and it's three-zero!"
