A beam of light streaks in.\
A blast follows, exploding with a delayed roar.\
It strikes —a terribly young, innocent -looking girl.

Her bright yellow magical cyberware dress flutters.\
Her hair dances softly, a shade of yellow bright enough to make one smile.\
　Her wide-open eyes sparkled like sunflower petals, and atop her head sat an adorable dog-ear headdress.

Centred on where she landed, yellow phosphorescence —cracks burst forth, shattering.\
The illegal high-rise structure collapsed.

"Whoa! Missed with the Yellow♥Punch!"\
"【Blue】!"\
"――!"

Black phosphorescence enveloped the 【Gemini Witch】.\
A jet-black mask obscured her expression.\
Her black dress billowed.\
Magical cyberware wings unfolded from her back —just one wing.

"No! Emerald!"\
"■■■ Run!"

　The brief warning from the 【Gemini Witch】.\
An exploding blast.\
The magical cyberware wings absorb the yellow shockwave.

"Chiiwaa..."

The moment the shock subsided.

"――Wah!"

A second impact.\
The fist of 【Chiwawa Yellow】, caught by the wings, pierces through.

　It was a spear.\
A strike concealed within chrome steel gloves shaped like paw pads.\
The 【M-70 Type Pile Bunker】. Grasping the enemy with the paw pads, it launches a stake from the palm's base.

Pierced wings.\
Mechanical feathers scatter into the sky.\
The jet-black mask of the 【Gemini Witch】 is struck and pierced.

"■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■!!"\
"Nwaah!?"

Swallowed by the collapsing illegal buildings, Sere looked up at it. The Witch of Gemini, her wings pierced. The black phosphorescent light she emitted.

　The sky was painted black.

"■■■■■■■■■■■ Green Vortex!"\
"Ginya!?"

A falling emerald light.\
It was a strike faster than sound.\
Falling from the heavens —a thunderbolt, followed by a delayed clap of thunder!

　The Gemini Witch generates an extraordinary amount of M-particles via its two Magus Engines, dispersing them into the air through its wings.\
The M-particles transmit thoughts and colour the space.\
And then.\
It freely manipulates the weather.

"...No! Emerald! Jade isn't here, so if you do that—!"\
"Ehehehe♥"

The lightning strike's impact point—【Chiwawa Yellow】 rises, billowing black smoke.

No damage to her yellow dress.\
No clouding in her yellow-glowing eyes.

"Ten years since the Hakodate Decisive Battle —data, output change! Feeling cocky, are we? Witch-san!"

　Not a single scratch marred 【Chiwawa Yellow】.\
The girl's pale skin felt no pain or discomfort whatsoever.\
Meanwhile, the opposing 【Gemini Witch】—crashed. Blood, dark and thick, spurted from her shattered mask as she plummeted into the rubble of collapsing illegal buildings.

　Right before Sere's eyes.

"...!"\
"Wafu!? M-mind your own business!? Oh dear, HQ will be furious..."\
"Emerald!"

Sere caught the falling witch in her arms.\
And then —she started running. Dodging the debris, trying to shake off the pursuers' gaze.

"...Ah..."

【Chiwawa Yellow】 smiled weakly.

"If it's you, Terrorist-san, I can get involved as much as I like, right?"

Eyes like sunflower petals locked onto the fleeing shadow.
