## Description

Cyberpunk × Magical Girl
Near future, Magus City Tokyo.
Within a dystopia where cyberspace expanded and information and science reigned supreme, 'Magical Girls' existed.

Girls clad in cyber decks/cybernetic armour, known as 'magic', raced through the city's shadows.
Their foes were 'witches' consumed by 'magic'.
What they must protect is the city's peace.
The truths uncovered sometimes wound the girls.

Run through the shadows.
Shoot without hesitation.
Never let your magic wane.
Never, ever get involved with a 'witch'.
