Black phosphorescence.
Flashes of gunfire.
Countless muzzles, connected, communicating, commanded by M-particle magic, grazed the scattered fragments of Viola Purple flesh, Strawberry Pink's cheek protected by M-particles.

Amidst the gunpowder dust, it stood.

　A non-human entity, smiling, levitating countless turreted unmanned gun emplacements.
A magical cyberware dress, eroded by M-particles, stained black, its edges frayed.
Peeking from beneath a frill-laden skirt were legs not human. Streamlined, fish-like, overloaded with magical cyberware —a tail.

　Legs were absent.
Her expression concealed by a jet-black mask.
A gaunt, emaciated girl, floating by M-Particle, possessing a fish's tail.
A demonic being, pointing at strawberry pink with her withered fingertips, commanding countless turrets.

"Referencing database—error. Attempting communication—error. Requesting reinforcements—error. Ha! I see, I see!"

　Strawberry Pink reeled in the M-Particles. Yet what her fingertips sensed was not the feedback of thought communication. It was the sensation of everything being obstructed.
Jamming.
The reason her communication with Viola Purple had been severed was condensed within the presence before her... within the 【Witch】.

"It's you, isn't it! The Pisces Witch!
The survivor of the Hakodate decisive battle!
The poor grown-up girl who could no longer be a magical girl!"

Dodging the concentrated fire of the turrets with pink light, Strawberry Pink narrowed her eyes.

"—I'll defeat you. I'll kill you."

A flash of pink streaked past, the Monofilament Whip.
　Dust was torn apart.
Fragments of buildings, shattered by blast and cutting force, were sliced at terrifying speeds, dancing countless through the air. The turrets were no exception —or so it should have been.

"Whoosh."

Black phosphorescence.
Colliding with the peach, exploding.
The turrets did not die. Countless muzzles continued to target Strawberry Pink.

"Oh, right. Of course. We're the same... aren't we?!"

Strawberry Pink pulled at the thread. A wall of pink thread formed.
Gunfire pierced through.

The wall was pierced.
Threads snapped and flew.
Closing in: bullets wrapped in black phosphorescent magic.
Dodged at the last moment —blood flowed down Strawberry Pink's cheek.

　M-particles can be neutralised by M-particles.
The magic protecting the girl from all impact can only be pierced by the same magic.
Only a magical girl can kill a witch, and only a witch can kill a magical girl.

A battle to the death between girls equipped with the same Magus Engine. Neglecting defence means death.

It resembled a school of fish.
　Countless turrets, suspended by M-particles, powered by M-particles.
Mounted with machine guns, rocket launchers, shotguns – swarms of unmanned artillery acting in unison, as if obeying a single will.

It resembled a shoal of sardines.
Each one a mere speck.
Yet when they surged together, they struck like a storm――.

"Bloody hell! Enough!"

Bullets whistled past.
Pink threads flew.
The target: the witch's neck. Its severance.
But emaciated fingers, glowing black, grasped the thread.

"Shit."

By the time she realised, it was too late.
　The operational hum of the Magus Engine, akin to a girl's scream.
The roaring energy grants the emaciated body vitality beyond its limits—grasping, pulling, drawing it closer, into the kill zone...!

"Not... by any chance!"

The instant it was pulled in.
The Magus Engine's pink operational hum.
The right arm, clad in the glove —is severed.

　The severed forearm. Peering through the cut surface were cables circulating M-particles. Chrome steel bones. Synthetic bioplastic flesh. The very essence of a magical girl. The remnants of modification.
Sacrificing the magical cyberware arm.
Kill zone range —the concentrated fire from the turrets scorched the severed forearm. Exploding, shooting, trampling, soft flesh dances.

All the turrets attacked the severed strawberry-pink forearm.
Strawberry Pink had been aiming for that.
The instant all the muzzles missed.

"Check"

Strawberry Pink held it in her remaining left arm.

"―Mate!"

The magic cyberdeck's staff.
Strawberry Pink smashed the rod-shaped device into the witch's heart...!
