The girl whistled softly.
Another night, Another Day. Another job, Another Run.
　Her comrades died, the terrorists gained momentum, and the girl's work always began in such circumstances. So today too, with a touch of loneliness and a heart full of excitement, the girl's delicate voice echoed through the night sky.

"'For peace. For tranquillity.'"

The incantation.
Floating M-particles —the glow of magical power.
　The Magus Engine implanted in the girl's heart activates, staining the skyscraper sky with a peach-coloured light. Shadows fall, and within them, the girl transforms.

The pink hoodie worn home from school now drapes her body like an adorned dress.

"'Therefore'."

Her wide-open eyes shimmered pink, sparkling like scattered stars.
Her lips, weaving the incantation, were coloured as if reflecting the girl's flushed cheeks.
Chrome steel gloves adorned her slender fingers.
A rod protruded from her liberated chest.
White fingers drew it out.

A magic cyberdeck staff.
A magic cyberware dress.
Magic M-particles, blinking so brightly they erode at the cellular level, coating hair and eyes.

"――【Strawberry Pink】! Summoned, I arrive!"

The girl 【Haruka Momotsuki】's work began, as it always did.
