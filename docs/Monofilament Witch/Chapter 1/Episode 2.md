M-Particle Magic changed the world.

　These luminous particles possessed the property of connecting to human thought and freely transmitting corresponding signals. They only reacted to humans with aptitude, yet that was sufficient to alter the world.

Missiles that locked onto enemies through thought alone.
Powered suits that deployed through thought alone.
Communication devices that enabled understanding through thought alone.
Guns that fired through thought alone.
Drones that swarmed through thought alone.
Motorcycles that raced through thought alone.

　Devices controlled by managing signals using M-Particles, moved at will.
People called it 'magic'.
Such was the extent to which 'magic' transcended human understanding.
For instance, suppose a nation's representative possessed aptitude for M-Particles.
Suppose that —merely by thinking— they could shoot down an enemy nation's key figure with a nuclear warhead?

The world collapsed once, brought down by M-Particles.

　The Third World War, the Fourth World War, the Battle of Hakodate.
An era when those dreaded words danced across the pages of textbooks.
The use of M-Particles was strictly prohibited.

But.

Terrorists wielded magic.
Governments, in response, could not avoid using magic themselves.

　Thus were born the 'Magical Girls'.
Children without official records, trained and conditioned to be easily mind-controlled by the government, their thoughts manipulated at will.
Drugged girls who, unless their thought locks were released by 'incantation', weren't even permitted to dream freely.

Their existence.
The government does not officially acknowledge it.
