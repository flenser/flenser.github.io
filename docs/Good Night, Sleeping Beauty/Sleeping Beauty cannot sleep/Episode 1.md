Episode One

The weight on my shoulder and the scent of citron-lemon woke me.\
Board at the first station, about thirty minutes to the station nearest the office.\
In that brief gap, my consciousness had simply drifted away.

　Probably sleep deprivation.\
I know the cause. Work stress. Too much caffeine.\
And overtime. And more overtime.\
Three years since graduating art college and landing a job at a medium-sized design firm.\
Not exactly a sweatshop... but the days of being chased by deadlines just keep coming.\
I struggle so much to fall asleep now, I even miss that enormous stuffed sheep, Miss Mary, I left back at my parents' place.\
　I couldn't tell anyone that at twenty-four, I still couldn't sleep without a body pillow.

I checked the LCD panel at the boarding platform and breathed a sigh of relief that I hadn't missed my stop.\
It was around then that I finally noticed.\
Someone's head was resting on my shoulder.\
A troublesome commuter who'd dozed off and leaned in without asking. A common occurrence on the train.\
Normally, I'd say, "Excuse me, please wake up." If that didn't work, I'd just push them off and stand up.

　But today, I hesitated to do either.\
Because the person was a younger girl.\
Fluffy, wavy flaxen hair, loosely tied with a crimson ribbon bow. Tiny hands hidden beneath a cream-coloured long-sleeved knit cardigan. A short red pleated skirt.\
How to put it... an overall relaxed, fluffy sort of feel.\
　Such a fluffy-style schoolgirl was peacefully snoring on my shoulder.\
Come to think of it, this girl had been standing next to me on the platform at the boarding station.

...Right then, what to do.

Wake her up forcefully, or just leave her be?\
I knew nothing about her.\
Only that I knew her destination. It was the same station as mine.\
　I'd seen a girl wearing the same skirt step off the train at the platform several times before.\
Twenty-five minutes left until arrival.\
Seeing the dark circles under her eyes, I decided to lend her my shoulder.\
A call with her boyfriend, exam revision, just staying up late.\
I didn't know the reason. But everyone has long nights. And sleepy mornings the next day.

"...Huh, ah."

Warm body heat radiated from where we touched, making me feel sleepy all over again.\
Strange. I'd only just woken from a doze.\
To stop myself nodding off, I checked my phone timeline.\
One of my mutual followers lamented their favourite idol's sudden graduation. Poor thing.\
Our stop was approaching.\
　I whispered into the girl's ear.

"We're here."

"Mmh?"

The girl flinched.\
Her droopy eyes opened halfway, looking utterly sleepy.\
Oh, I thought. Long lashes, a nose that didn't stand out. A sharp jawline. Large eyes.\
I'd suspected it, but yes, definitely. No mistake.\
　This child is adorable.\
Even accounting for the dark circles beneath her eyes and those half-closed lids, she was a level of cuteness you wouldn't see just anywhere.\
Like a princess.\
She was so utterly adorable, I almost blurted out some unnecessary concern like, "It's dangerous to nod off with a face like that."\
I held back sharply and continued.

"You're getting off at this station, right? Come on, wake up."

"...Hm..."

Her cherry-blossom-pink lips quivered restlessly.\
The princess seemed sleepy.\
But the train slowed gradually and finally came to a halt.\
The doors slid open with a whoosh, and countless passengers streamed out.\
　The girl didn't move a muscle. Still seated, she stared blankly at my face through half-open eyes.\
This was troublesome. If this continued, she'd be late. Not me, but her.\
Passengers began boarding. There was no time left.\
Right then, I grabbed her hand.

"Let's get off, come on!"

"Eh?"

Without hesitation, I pulled her forcefully onto the platform.\
The moment we stepped off the carriage, the doors closed behind us. The platform doors shut, and the train sped off towards the next station.\
Only then did I realise what I'd done.\
Blimey. I'd grabbed a schoolgirl's hand. Without permission.\
Is this alright? If I were a man, I'd be in trouble. But since we're the same sex, is it okay?

"Um—"

The girl looked up at my face.\
Her eyes were still half-closed, as if she were half-asleep.

"I don't know who you are or where you're from, but thank you for your kindness."

Her friendly words made me secretly breathe a sigh of relief. Good. It seemed unlikely she'd call the station staff.

"No, I'm the one who's sorry. For suddenly pulling you like that."

"No, not that. Ah, well, that too, but—"

The girl pointed to my shoulder.

"Your shoulder. For lending it to me."

She gave a soft, floppy smile. She was even cuter when she smiled.\
Or rather, that's what you were thanking me for?

"Thanks to you, I had a proper deep sleep for the first time in ages."

"In ages?"

"Yes."

She nodded cheerfully. Did she not get much sleep normally?\
　True, the dark circles under her eyes were pretty intense.

"You really shouldn't stay up so late."

"Ahaha, you're right—"

She laughed awkwardly, then gave a cute little yawn. She really was sleep-deprived.\
Still, are all kids like this these days? So confident, or rather, so used to dealing with adults?\
Well, I'm only twenty-four myself. Still.

"Mind you don't nod off. Trains can be dodgy these days. Peeping toms and all."

"Aye."

"Right then, I'll be off."

"Ah, wait, miss!"

Suddenly, the girl grabbed the hem of my coat.\
What now? Was she going to report me after all?

"How long was I asleep?"

What on earth?\
Well, I woke up at that station, and it took twenty-five minutes to get here. But judging by the way she was, she must have been asleep a bit longer than that.

"...Probably about thirty minutes."

"Thirty minutes? That long?"

She said it with surprise.\
Is thirty minutes generally considered "that long"? It might be a matter of personal perception. Well, it is quite a long time for dozing off on the train.

"You were fast asleep. Really, it's dangerous. You must get proper sleep at night."

Saying something reasonable, I mocked myself inwardly.\
What a know-it-all. You were nodding off right next to her yourself.\
Still, as an elder's duty, I meant to sound at least serious with my warning. But the girl seemed far away, muttering something under her breath.

"...The swaying? The time? No, everything's the same as always..."

What was that about? Was something bothering her?\
Oh, no time for that now. I've got a meeting first thing this morning.\
Turning half away, she raised a hand lightly.

"Right then, take care. Off you go."

Goodbye felt too grand, and see you later was probably wrong.\
So I gave that sort of farewell and hurried towards the stairs.\
I could feel her gaze on my back the whole time, but I didn't turn around.
