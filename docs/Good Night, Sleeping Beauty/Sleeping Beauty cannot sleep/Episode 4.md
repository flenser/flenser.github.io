Episode Four

"Sorry to interrupt your fun. Here's your decaf coffee, hot sandwich, and that parfait you ordered."

A light, toasty aroma wafted up, instantly drawing my attention to the plates.\
My order was placed on the table one item after another.\
Coffee steaming with white vapour. A hot sandwich cut into triangles.\
　A clear teapot filled with tea leaves and a teacup. A parfait piled high in a tall glass.\
The parfait, above all, caught my eye.\
Was that... persimmon?\
From the bottom layer upwards: orange jelly, pale yellow mousse, diced sweet potato, Kyoho grapes, Shine Muscat grapes, topped with a generous swirl of whipped cream.\
　Topped with sliced persimmon and marrons glacés that shimmer like jewels. Accompanied by thin chocolate shavings, it tickles that part of you that can only be described as girlish.\
I startled, noticing the gaze fixed on me.\
With a rather spiteful, upward glance, Ibara asks.

"Would you like some parfait too, big sis?"

"No, I don't want any."

"Oh? But Aki-chan's parfait is delicious!"

That much was obvious to see.\
But I'm an adult. Proper adults don't eat parfaits at night. Probably.\
Besides, my hot sandwich is every bit as tempting, isn't it?\
The melted, gooey Cheddar cheese and generous slices of prosciutto peeking out from the golden-brown, crispy bread. I couldn't help but swallow hard.

"Let's eat."

Unable to resist, I reached out and took a bite.\
From the very first mouthful, the rich, savoury flavour of the cheese hit my brain like a punch. An undeniably delicious taste resonating in my empty stomach.\
And then, the ham. The meaty texture of the layered pastrami and the sharp, spicy kick of the peppercorns.\
　As I ate bite after bite, the chopped pickles appeared, and they were brilliant too. Just the right amount of tartness to refresh my mouth, and the satisfying crunch was delightful.\
To sum it up... absolutely delicious.\
It was so delicious I devoured it in a trance.\
I looked up with a start to find Ibara, seated opposite, grinning teasingly.

"You must have been starving, sis."

"...Well, I was working late. Didn't even have time for dinner."

I muttered the excuse under my breath and picked up the coffee cup.\
I took a sip and was surprised. This was delicious too.

Usually, I found decaffeinated coffee rather lacking. It always seemed a bit thin and watery. I'd always assumed that was just how it was, since they reduce the caffeine content.\
　But this coffee was incredibly good. The aroma that filled my nose, the balance of bitterness and acidity – it hit my taste buds spot on.\
Behind the counter, the master, called Aki-chan, wore a pleased look.

"Since we're a late-night café, we put a lot of effort into our decaffeinated menu too."

"Late-night? How late are you open?"

"We're open from six in the evening until midnight."

"Wow. It feels a bit like a bar, doesn't it?"

"Maybe. It's alright to have one place like this, isn't it? This area's quite safe too."

Aki-san, smiling, held a quiet, almost benevolent warmth.\
A refuge for those with nowhere to be at night. Perhaps that's what this place was.\
As I stared blankly at Aki-san, my cheek was suddenly grabbed.　　\
　Forced to face forward, Ibara puffed out her cheeks in displeasure.

"Miss, you're looking around too much. I get it, Aki-chan's beautiful, so you look. But listen to me now."

That's right.\
What were we talking about? Ah, yes. I remember now.\
It was about Ibara, who suffers from insomnia, somehow being able to sleep only when seated next to me.\
Is that even possible? That's all I could think, but Ibara was dead serious.

"If my sister is here, I can sleep. I should be able to sleep."

Surely, it's just coincidence.\
　Logically speaking, there's no other explanation.\
If it's psychosomatic, then all the more reason such things might happen.\
She happened to fall asleep.\
And I happened to be sitting beside her at that moment.\
Nothing more than that. Pure coincidence.\
But she doesn't seem to think so.\
She's clutching at a thread of salvation thinner than a spider's web, even invoking such an exaggerated word as 'fate'.\
　This child had been waiting for me. For hours. At a station in late autumn, cold enough to seep into your bones, after dusk had fallen.

"I'm sorry for suddenly suggesting a hotel. But I need to sleep. Just for one night."

Her eyes, heavy with dark circles, fixed on me.

"If you let me sleep, I'll do anything."

I finally felt I understood the desperation this child held.\
Not being able to sleep must be painful. Must be hard.\
Hard enough to cling to a passing stranger.

Mornings after a sleepless night are truly awful. Six months of that? It's nothing but a nightmare.\
　This answer might be wrong. It might not be something a twenty-four-year-old should say to a seventeen-year-old they're bound to.\
But.

"You don't have to say 'anything'."

"Eh?"

"Just so you know, it's only for one night."

Before I knew it, I'd said it.

"I don't think it means anything... but alright. Tonight, I'll sleep with you."
