Sleeping Beauty and the Drunkard. Part One

Midnight, 11 PM.\
I was lounging around in Shigure-san's room, watching videos.

"Even if the magic wore off at midnight, the glass slipper is yours." This is Hime Haibara, the white-themed member of Charles. Right then, I'm absolutely starving right now. My manager told me there's a pumpkin dish specialist restaurant in Tokyo, so I thought I'd go try it. I do like pumpkin, you see. Simmered dishes and such. Cinderella and all that. That sort of thing, I suppose."

"Hime, you're really putting in the effort..."

Watching the video filmed with a selfie camera, I lay sprawled on Shigure-san's bed.\
Normally, I try not to look at my phone after ten o'clock, but days when there's a new notification on the "Charles" channel are special.\
　Just as I hit 'Like', I heard the clatter of keys turning in the lock.\
It was Shigure-san.

"I'm home!"

Hurrying to the entrance, I found Shigure-san looking rather dazed.\
Blimey, I thought.\
Because Shigure-san was clearly drunk. Properly plastered. I told you so.\
　The smell of alcohol was strong, her cheeks were flushed, her droopy eyes were glistening, and her breath occasionally mixed with agonising sighs like "Mmm..." or "Haaah..."—how to put it.\
Well, how to put it.

"Ah—Ibaraaa."

Shigure-san smiled weakly.

"You're so cute today too."

POW!\
My head exploded.\
Huh? What is this erotic-cute creature?\
　Her flushed cheeks, moist eyes, plump lips, legs barely able to stand, the nape of her neck visible through the gap in her grown-up cute coat... it's practically begging for it, but I'm getting so horny, no, this is bad, if I leave her like this she'll get attacked, eaten, it's dangerous, what should I do, see, that's why I need to lock her up properly, tie her wrists, confine her, alright, first things first, rope and handcuffs, the 24-hour hardware store... Were they around here?──

"Oh ho, so you're 'Ibara-chan'?"

"B-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b But—Shigure-san's friend.\
My mental alarm bells went off.\
Seeing my reaction, the savannah woman smirked, one corner of her mouth curling up.

"Oi oi, don't make such a scary face. Ame's car broke down, so I just sent her over."

"Ame?"

"Huh? Ah, it's a nickname. 'Rain' sea 'rain'—so Ame."

　So that's what they used to call Shigure-san.\
This person knows a Shigure-san I don't know.\
The thought made my heart flutter uneasily.

"Haru, thanks for the taxi, eh?"

"Oh. Treat me to something next time."

The black-haired woman patted Shigure's head, like she was patting a child.\
Hey, hold on, whoops.\
　No, no. I must control my facial muscles properly. This person is Shigure-san's friend, after all.\
The fact she knows my name means Shigure-san has told her about the situation. So there's no need to hide it.\
I crafted my best smile and directed it towards the woman called Haru.

"Wow, thank you ever so much. Actually, Shigure-san, you're completely sloshed. I told you not to drink too much."

"I'm not drunk, you know?"

"Enough with the corny jokes. Here, hold on."

"Right..."

Shigure-san grabbed my upper arm and kicked off her pumps with her heels. The shoes were carelessly discarded. Seeing this sloppiness, something she'd never normally show, sent a shiver down my spine.\
Seeing me like this, the woman nodded as if she understood something.

"I knew it."

"...What is it?"

"Nah, nothing. My intuition's not half bad, is it?"

"Huh."

What on earth is she talking about?\
Just when I thought she'd leave, the Savannah woman put her hand to her chin and stared intently at my face.\
Whoa, that's a bit close. I charge for that kind of distance.

"I see. So this is what it's actually like. You do look a bit similar, I suppose... Ah, I could see myself liking you..."

What on earth is she talking about?\
I wish she'd hurry up and leave. It's getting quite late, I think.

"Miss, are you alright for the last train?"

"Oops."

The woman glanced at her phone and muttered, "Blimey."

"I'm off. Take good care of Ame, pretty schoolgirl."

"That's sexual harassment."

Ignoring my protest, the savage woman leaned close to my ear.\
She whispered in a voice Shigure couldn't hear.

"—Don't attack her, okay?"

My mind went completely blank.

"When Ame's down, she'll cling to whoever's nearby. Doesn't matter if they're older or younger. I'm used to dodging it, but you're just a schoolgirl, are you?"

"Wh-what⁉︎"

"Non-consensual stuff is a crime, you know. Try to resist."

"…………No, what have you been saying all this time… o-oh, you're saying…"

The savannah woman patted my confused shoulders hard, then took a step back.

"Right then. Goodnight, Ame. Keep yourself in check, schoolgirl."

"Yeah, goodnight."

Still clinging to my arm, Shigure-san waved flutteringly.\
The heavy door slammed shut, and Haru-san's smiling face vanished. I couldn't help but breathe a sigh of relief.\
In this short time, I realised one thing.\
　I don't like that 'Haru' person. I can't stand her.\
And then—

"Come on, Shigure-san, let's change over there first. Your clothes will get creased."

"No way."

"Huh?"

"I want you to take them off..."

"Huh???"

And so began my sleepless night's endurance challenge of rationality (until morning).
