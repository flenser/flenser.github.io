Episode Thirteen

And so, my daily routine underwent a significant transformation.\
Specifically, my days, which had been a cycle of home, work, convenience store, home, became home, work, Sereno, home (with Ibara).\
How did this happen?

　　†

"Mmm, yummy."

"That's good..."

In the living room bathed in morning light, a schoolgirl in uniform nibbled at a slice of toast.\
I'd grown utterly accustomed to this surreal scene.

"Shigure-san, I bought milk yesterday. Would you like some?"

"I think I will."

Ibara stood up and headed towards the refrigerator.\
　My personal life had undergone a dramatic transformation in the last few days.\
Take this breakfast, for instance.\
The toast I was eating now was slathered in golden apple jam.\
I was the type who preferred cereal for breakfast, and if I had bread, I wanted butter or cheese on it (I did own a toaster, after all). So there was no jam in the fridge. There hadn't been.\
　Now there is.\
Ibara, dissatisfied with breakfast being nothing but cereal, bought it at the local supermarket.\
Ibara has also brought various other things into our home. Starting with underwear and uniforms, then chargers, cosmetics, tableware...\
Before I knew it, the room felt considerably cramped.\
The unsettling phrase 'semi-cohabitation' flickered through my mind.\
Semi-cohabiting with a high school girl.\
　...Hmm, guilty as charged!\
No, wait. Actually, that's not funny at all.\
Anyway, living together like this, I've become certain of one thing.\
Ibara is rich. At least, for a mere high school student.\
I don't know why, but this sleep-deprived, fluffy-haired schoolgirl clearly isn't short of money.\
That ninety thousand yen thing she mentioned the other day? Probably not a joke either.\
　If she wanted to pay, she could easily afford it.\
Somehow, I just get that feeling.\
Actually, her cosmetics seem to be department store brands, and fairly high-end ones at that.

"Here you go."

"Thanks."

I take the mug filled with milk. This is my mug. In Ibara's hand is the mug she brought from home.\
I've digressed.\
The issue right now isn't Ibara's financial situation.\
　It's this current situation.\
Even though I've accepted money for living expenses, I can't keep living like this forever, or so I think.

"Ibara."

"What?"

Still chewing her toast, Ibara tilted her head slightly.

"Just to confirm. Your insomnia hasn't gone away yet, has it?"

"Of course."

She nodded emphatically.

"Thanks to Shigure-san lately, it's improved quite a bit though. I can manage three or four hours now. It's a world of difference from before."

By my definition, three or four hours doesn't count as sleep. At best, it's a nap or a snooze.\
But pointing that out wouldn't help.

"I'm fairly energetic at night, but I'm still sleepy during the day. I'm practically a regular at the school infirmary."

"So, you still can't sleep at all when you're alone?"

Ibara gave a slight nod.

"I've tried all sorts of things, but none of them work when I'm alone. I need Shigure-san right beside me."

"Hmm. But we can't keep going like this forever..."

　Munch.\
Chewing on her fox-coloured toast, Ibara turned her half-open eyes towards me.\
A faint unease flickered deep within her clear pupils.

"Am I really... a bother?"

"That's..."

"I'm sorry. I know I'm getting in your way, Shigure-san..."

Sigh.\
The high school girl hung her head pitifully (cute).\
　My conscience twisted painfully.

"I see. I really shouldn't come anymore, should I? I understand. From today, I'll sleep alone. Even if I can't sleep. But Shigure-san, thank you for everything so far..."

A small sniffle.\
Oh, for goodness' sake.

"You're welcome to come over! I don't think it's a bother at all, and I'm getting my share of the living expenses properly."

Resigned, I said that, and Ibara finished off the last of the toast with a completely unfazed expression, saying, "Oh? Well, that's good then." Come on now.

"...Ibara. Was that just now... an act?"

"Hehe."

Please don't try to gloss it over with that clumsy cuteness.

"Sorry, sorry. But I really do feel bad. So if there's anything you want me to do, please just say."

"Like what?"

"A massage, for instance. You're definitely knotted up, Shigure-san. I'm actually pretty good at it."

The schoolgirl wiggled her fingertips.\
No, that's a bit much. The visual, or rather the written description, is just a bit too much.\
I don't need that, I sighed.

"Not exactly in exchange, but... Can I ask you something?"

"What?"

"What's it like when you can't sleep at night?"

Ibara stroked the skin beneath her eyes, murmuring, "Hmm..."\
The dark circles under both eyes were proof of her insomnia.\
They seemed lighter than when we first met, but they were still distinctly visible.

"You know, you close your eyes thinking you have to sleep. But you can't. But the hum of the aircon and the sound of cars passing by cling to your ears, and you start to get irritated. You get more and more anxious, thinking 'I absolutely must sleep tonight', and that just makes it harder to fall asleep."

"That's... well... tough, isn't it?"

"...Mm."

I looked again at the girl sitting cross-legged before me.\
Shinomori Ibara, this princess who couldn't sleep, had appeared before me far too suddenly.\
　Come to think of it, I know nothing about her. Even though we sleep together.\
Why does she live with her cousin instead of her parents? And why is she a bit well-off?\
Why, has she become unable to sleep?

I know nothing.\
But one thing is clear.\
Things can't go on like this.

"I hope you get better."

No, that's not right.\
　Having gone this far, I couldn't just treat it like someone else's problem now.\
I corrected myself.

"Let's fix it. If there's anything I can do, I'll help. Not just by sleeping together."

Ibara blinked twice, then flashed a faint smile tinged with resignation.

"It's impossible. Nothing's worked so far. The only magic that works on me is yours, Shigure-san."

"But surely it'd be better if you could sleep more? Not just three or four hours, but properly through until morning."

"That... is true."

She gently lowered her eyes.\
Ibara can only sleep when she's with me.\
This must be some sort of conditioning.\
Because Ibara herself believes, "I can sleep when Amami Shigure is nearby," she can sleep.\
　The power of human belief is not to be underestimated. I've heard of people whose health deteriorates from their own convictions, or conversely, whose illnesses are cured by placebos.\
So then, what if she could sleep longer and more deeply?\
If she could accumulate successful experiences of "sleeping well," wouldn't she eventually learn to sleep properly?

I'm neither a doctor nor a sleep specialist, so I have no solid evidence. But at the very least, her anxiety and frustration about her insomnia would surely lessen.\
　And then, someday, if Ibara's insomnia were completely cured and she could sleep on her own...\
Then I'd finally be free.\
No need to feel guilty about abandoning a younger girl.\
So.

"I'll help you. Cure your insomnia."

I declared.\
Ibara looked at me questioningly.

"Really? You'll do anything?"

"I didn't say anything."

Perhaps you ought to stop reading too much into what people say.

"But I'll listen to whatever you can tell me."

"...Then, I want to have a bath every day. Not just a shower. I feel like that helps me sleep."

"Right, understood."

"Before bed tonight, I'd like us to drink sweet hot milk together."

"All right."

Ibara held the mug she'd brought with both hands and took a sip of the milk inside.\
She looked up at him with a slightly clingy expression.

"And then... would it be alright if I snuggled up close to you?"

Come to think of it, the only time Ibara had snuggled up in bed was on the first night. After that, she'd stayed still at the edge of the bed.\
　Huh, had she been holding back? She could have been a bit more affectionate.

"Sure. If it helps you sleep."

"You'll let me do anything?"

"It's no big deal."

"Shigure-san, you really are kind... That might not be quite right, though."

The latter part was more of a muttered aside. But it caught my attention.

"What's not good about it?"

"Nothing. Right then, it's your turn now, Shigure-san."

"Eh?"

Ibara held up three fingers.

"I made three requests, so you can make three requests of me too."

"...I see."

Well, even so.\
Asking for the spare key back... that's probably not worth it anymore. I'll give up on that.\
　Is there anything else? Something I want to ask Ibara.\
Nothing immediately springs to mind. After pondering for a moment, I turn my head around, or try to, and an ominous "clunk" sounds.

"...Sorry. Will you join me for some stretching tonight?"

"Not a massage?"

"St-re-t-ching."

Massage doesn't look quite right in writing.

"What about the other two?"

Even if you ask, I can't think of them so suddenly... Ah.\
I've got one.

"Then, I'd like you to accompany me a little. This weekend. Let's go shopping."

"Eh?"

Ibara's eyes widened at my words.
