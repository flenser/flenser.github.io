Episode 4: I'll definitely make you pay for today's taxi fare later

"Right then, to celebrate Aosawa-san becoming the secretary... Cheers!"

At Manager Yamazato's toast, glasses clinked in unison.

Today was both Aosawa-chan's farewell party and a celebration for her becoming the president's secretary. This was the first time the Budget Management Department members had gone out drinking together.

　They downed their mugs as if to wash away the day's fatigue, pouring beer straight into their stomachs.

"It's wonderful news, but I'll miss being around Aosawa-chan."

Sure, they'd still be on the same floor and could see each other anytime, but not being able to grab lunch together or pop out for drinks after work like before would be terribly lonely.\
　Aosawa-chan was my little ray of sunshine, you know.\
I gazed at the face of my cute junior sitting opposite, feeling it deeply.

Seno-san, sitting next to me, picked a piece of yakitori off its skewer, glanced at Aosawa-chan, and murmured.

"Still, it's really impressive, isn't it? How on earth did she charm the president? Does Aosawa-san seem quiet but turn out to be surprisingly aggressive?"

"Well, I just followed your advice, Seno-san, and kept visiting the president's office to show my enthusiasm..."

"Hmm, I see. Still, I'm rather envious. You might have a knack for attracting wealthy people, Aosawa-san. I mean, the person you like is rich too, right? Or is he already your boyfriend?"

　Seno-san grinned broadly as she fired off questions in rapid succession, pressing Aosawa-chan.

Glancing sideways at them, I took a bite of my yakitori. I don't bother with fiddly things like taking it off the skewer. It's definitely tastier eaten straight off.

"No, um, we're not lovers. I just... like him..."

"Not lovers?　But come on, you always wear those earrings – it's definitely a present, right?"

Seno-san pointed at her own ear and laughed mockingly.\
Only then did I understand what Seno-san had meant the other day when she said you could tell if Aosawa-chan had someone by "looking at her ears".

Ah, so that's what she was talking about – these earrings.

Aosawa-chan had worn these white clover earrings ever since we first met.\
　Peeking out occasionally from her fine, soft chestnut hair, it was like her trademark. I'd always assumed she just liked it so much she kept wearing the same pair.

Oh, so it was a gift from someone she liked... Loyal, earnest, sweet. A world away from a certain someone.

"Getting such an expensive present but not dating? Could he be married or something?　That's no good, you know. No affair business. Aosawa-san's so cute, it'd be a waste. Even if he's loaded, you won't be happy, so just leave it alone."

"Seno-san, come on, that's not possible, is it?"

Aosawa-chan flushed and gave a troubled smile.\
Seeing this, I felt Seno-san was enjoying teasing Aosawa-chan, so I couldn't stand by and watched. I reached out and gave Seno-san's ear a sharp pinch.

"Listen, don't bully Aosawa-chan like that."

"Mitsuya-san, that hurts!"

"And these earrings of yours? It's probably a present from someone, right?"

I didn't know if the earrings sparkling in Seno-san's ear was expensive or not.\
But Seno-san seemed the type who, even if it was a present from an ex-boyfriend, would just say something like, "The object itself isn't to blame, right?" and keep wearing it normally. Actually, definitely.

"No, I bought this myself."

Thinking 'Yeah, right,' I let go. Seno-san then rubbed the ear I'd been pinching, looking rather displeased.

＊＊＊

I'd only just realised during the training session the other day that Seno-san was the type who drank badly.

That's precisely why watching her next to me rapidly polish off her beer glass makes me feel increasingly uneasy.\
Seeing her slender, crimson-tinged throat swallow the beer made me recall that night, and I hastily averted my gaze.

"...Aren't you drinking a bit too much?"

"Eh?"

Worried the alcohol might make her slip up about the other day's events, I reached to take the drink away. But Seno-san, sensing my intent, swiftly and deftly moved the mug out of reach.

"What's the matter? This is perfectly normal, isn't it?"

"Your face is bright red. You really ought to stop."

"And you're the one who hasn't touched a drop since earlier. You really can't hold your drink, can you? Cute."

I glared at her as she narrowed her eyes teasingly.

"It's not that I can't hold my drink. Unlike you, I just know how to drink properly."

"Hmm. Well then, let's see you drink for real. Let's have a competition to see who can hold their drink better."

　I personally think you enjoy drinking more when you keep it at a pleasant buzz rather than getting completely plastered, but apparently this one isn't that type.

Seno-san grabbed the order tablet. Even when I reached out to take it, she deftly dodged my hand and placed the order, so I gave up, propped my elbow on the table and sighed.

When the two mugs arrived at the table, Seno-san plonked them down right in front of me.\
　At this point, I felt like giving up and decided I didn't care anymore. Without hesitation, I took a huge gulp from my mug. Don't underestimate an athletic club member's drinking capacity.

"Um... Mitsuya-san and Seno-san, are you both alright drinking that much?"

Aosawa-chan, sitting opposite us, sipped her lemon sour cautiously while watching us with concern.\
Lately, I've been causing this cute junior nothing but worry.\
　Aosawa-chan would subtly step in when Seno-san and I argued, acting as a buffer between us.

"It's fine, it's fine. Don't worry."

I repeated it, almost to myself.\
Truthfully, I was anxious beyond belief. Without Aosawa-chan here, could I really get along with this bloke? Especially after what happened.

　＊＊＊

"Hey, stop leaning on me! Walk straight. You're heavy!"

By the time we left the pub, Seno-san was staggering so badly she couldn't walk unaided. Reluctantly, I offered my shoulder and started walking as if carrying her.

　A faint, wafting scent of perfume.\
As I pulled her closer to steady her, feeling the softness of her body pressed against mine, I felt like looking up to the heavens.

She was the one who started this, yet she drinks herself into this state? Normally...

When we finally caught up with the two who'd managed to leave the izakaya ahead of us, Manager Yamazato turned and smiled at me.

"Right then, Mitsuya-san, you take responsibility and see Seno-san safely home, won't you? Well, good work tonight! My husband's here to pick me up, so I'll be off now. Everyone, see you back at the office."

Manager Yamazato waved to us and left without a second thought.

　No way, wait a minute... "Take her home"? You don't seriously expect me to take this girl home?\
I couldn't help but glance at Aosawa-chan. She shook her head frantically from side to side.

Well, I get it.\
Aosawa-chan's place is in the opposite direction to Seno-san's, and honestly, leaving my cute junior alone with a drunk who could do God knows what...

"Seno-san, come on, you can get home on your own, can't you? Stand up and walk yourself."

I grabbed her shoulders and shook her, but her body just wobbled limply. She was in no state to make it home unaided.

"Oh, for goodness' sake, Kaori, you're so annoying."

Hearing my name, Kaori, I instinctively stopped shaking him.\
This girl, of all people, in front of Aosawa-chan...

"Um, Mitsuya-san. I don't think Seno-san can manage getting home alone..."

I forced a smile for Aosawa-chan, who was watching me as if gauging my reaction.

"Ah, ahaha, you're right. Got it, leave it to me. You take care getting home, Aosawa-chan."

"Yes, thank you."

"Eh? Aosawa-san, you're leaving already? Oh, I see. That's a shame. Hey, let's go to one more place, Kao... Mmmph!"

I covered Seno-san's mouth with my palm to cut her off. I couldn't have her spilling any more beans.

If she started hinting at what happened that night, my working life would be over. That would be no laughing matter, no matter what.

"Shut up. Please, don't say another word. You're far too drunk."

I pushed Seno-san back, who was trying to mumble a complaint, and turned back to Aosawa-chan with a wry smile.

Please, just go home quickly while I'm holding her down...! I conveyed this with my eyes alone. Aosawa-chan nodded once and waved goodbye to us.

　After somehow placating her and shoving her into the taxi despite her insistence on going to one more place, Seno-san, grumbling, gave the driver her home address.

At first, Seno-san had been muttering, but perhaps unable to withstand the taxi's gentle rocking, she had quietly fallen asleep, her head resting against the window.

　Small raindrops began tapping against the window.\
Feeling thoroughly disheartened, I averted my gaze from Seno-san and stared out the opposite window.\
As if to intensify the muggy heat, the rain gradually grew heavier, fogging the window glass.

　Inside the moving cab, I listened to the radio voice drifting in, letting out a quiet sigh, careful no one else heard.

She's a storm of a woman.

A violent storm with heavy rain and strong winds, lashing sideways. She sweeps everything up, wrecks everything, yet leaves nothing behind once she's passed.

　＊＊＊

"Excuse me, I need to drop this person off at their house and come back, so could you wait here for me?"

When I told the taxi driver this,

"It's fine to wait, but I'll need you to settle the fare first, you see."

He said. So, reluctantly, I paid by credit card and dragged Seno-san out of the taxi by her arm.\
　I don't know how taxi fares are calculated, but I felt like I'd lost out on the initial fare. Bloody hell.

"Right, let's go."

"Okaaay."

I lent her my shoulder as she stumbled along, her speech slurred, and we headed towards the entrance of the apartment building she pointed at. The rain had eased off slightly since earlier, but it was still enough to soak us through, and I regretted not bringing an umbrella.

"Hey, where's the key?"

"In my bag."

She handed me her small black designer bag. I snatched it and rummaged inside. Surprisingly tidy, the key case was found straight away.

After unlocking the door and stepping inside, we got into the lift directly in front of us.

"Which floor?"

"Sixteenth floor."

She was so drunk she couldn't walk properly on her own, yet she was happily humming to herself. I sighed in exasperation.

　I wanted to say something, but knowing she couldn't hold her drink and still letting her drink, I was just as bad.

In the ascending lift, I stared at the floor indicator, praying we'd reach her floor as quickly as possible.

We arrived at her door. I held the card key to the door. As soon as the unlocking sound rang out, I shoved the key case back into her bag, which I was holding for her.

"Right, I'm off then."

"Eh? You're leaving already? Let's have another drink."

"Can't. I've got a taxi waiting downstairs."

"Oh, that's a shame."

I opened the door and pushed her into the hallway with some effort.\
Then Seno-san smiled, grabbed my arm, and dragged me back inside.

"Blimey!"

Seno-san plonked herself down on the landing. Then, grinning broadly, she held out her foot to me.

"Hey Kaori, take off my strap before you leave."

I stared blankly at the white instep of her foot.\
Black pumps. A strap wrapped around her slender ankle.

This woman was telling me to take off her shoes. Who the hell did she think she was...!

"Hurry up."

She dangled her foot, wiggling it to get my attention, laughing with genuine delight.

　I clenched my teeth, bent down, and stifled the urge to protest.\
Stay calm. Right now, getting into an argument with this drunk is less important than getting out of here as quickly as possible. Best to just do as she says.

Reluctantly, I reached out. Lifting her ankle and supporting it with one hand, I did the right foot. Then the left. As I undid the straps one by one, Seno-san laughed.

"Thanks. You're so kind, aren't you? Kaori, would you do anything if I asked?"

"...Don't get cocky, you drunk!"

Furious, I jabbed her forehead.\
"Ow!" she whinged. I flung her designer bag at her, slammed the door shut, and fled the room.

　＊＊＊

Carrying someone nearly my own height proved surprisingly taxing. By the time I reached home, my arms felt heavy and sluggish, and to top it off, my back ached.

I flung my rain-soaked coat aside and collapsed onto the sofa, utterly exhausted. A wave of fatigue washed over me, leaving me without the energy to even get up.

"...I'll definitely make you pay for today's taxi fare later..."

Despite being exhausted, closing my eyes didn't bring sleep easily. All that kept replaying in my mind was her.

Ridiculous. What am I even conscious of?

In the end, it was just as she'd pointed out on the rooftop.

"You don't need to be so conscious of it."

　Recalling that defiant smile she wore as she said it fills me with such rage I feel like clawing at my chest.

I want to ask her instead.\
How can you be so utterly unfazed?

It's too humiliating to tell anyone I'm being toyed with by a female colleague.

In the end, I lay there again today, clutching these half-formed feelings, abandoning all thought and closing my eyes tightly, tightly shut.
