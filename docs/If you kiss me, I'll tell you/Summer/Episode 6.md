Episode 6: That's Why You're Not Popular, Kaori!

"Please, come in."

This was my second time at Seno-san's place.\
When I'd brought her home after she'd passed out drunk, I hadn't gone inside the flat itself, so this was my first time stepping into this room.

"A one-bedroom flat? It's quite spacious."

A tidy, feminine room. The living area featured a long-pile white rug and a two-seater camel-coloured sofa taking centre stage.

A sweet scent filled the air. Glancing around, I spotted a room fragrance on the low cabinet, several wooden sticks protruding from it.

It was a stark contrast to my own clean, utilitarian room. Even here, the difference in feminine charm was apparent.

"Sit down, please. What would you like to drink?"

I settled onto the sofa as instructed. Taking a deep breath to calm my slightly racing heart, I watched her back as she stood in the kitchen, eyeing the contents of the fridge.

"Is there anything besides beer?"

"Plenty of things. Would you like something mixed?"

I couldn't help but wryly smile at the array of unfamiliar bottles lining the kitchen counter.

"...You're a proper drinker, aren't you? Beer's fine for me."

"Is that so? Right, I'll have beer too then. Want a glass?"

"No need. Straight from the can's fine."

"Got it."

After placing my can of beer on the table, Seno-san stood up, popped the tab, and gave my can a little tap.

"Cheers."

　I stole a glance at her as she happily put her lips to the can and downed it in one go. She didn't seem to have any ulterior motives... or so it appeared.

After quenching my thirst, parched by the saltiness of the ramen, Seno-san sat down beside me.

Our shoulders touched.

Or so I thought, until she leaned heavily against my shoulder. Startled, I choked on the beer that had gone down the wrong way, coughing violently.

"Guh-huh! Guh-huh-guh-huh!"

"Eh? Are you alright?"

I glared tearfully at Seno-san, who was patting my back worriedly.

What the hell is this girl thinking!?

"Close! You startled me! What the hell was that all of a sudden!"

"Eh? Kaori, what's with that reaction? You sound like a virgin."

"Virgin!?"

What kind of thing is that to say!? I wanted to retort, but Seno-san was looking at me with amusement and laughing, so I lost my words.

A slender arm reached out. I reflexively leaned back, but she paid no heed, slipping her arm around my back and hugging me.

A soft, sweet scent. My cheek pressed against her chest, and I froze completely.

"...Your heart's pounding."

Seno-san said cheerfully. Snapping back to my senses, I grabbed her slender shoulders and pulled her off with all my strength.

"Hold on, are you drunk already? Isn't that a bit early?"

"I'm not drunk. I've only had a little."

"Then what's this? What's going on?"

"Well, didn't you come here with that in mind?"

"Huh!?"

Her matter-of-fact reply left me utterly bewildered.\
I stared into her dark brown eyes. I was too stunned to even feign composure.

After meeting my wavering gaze, Seno-san smiled.\
Her palm pressed gently against my chest. Realising she could feel my heartbeat, I frantically pushed her hand away.

"Wait, let's sort this out. So you mean you intended to..."

"Do I have to spell it out? If you didn't mean to, Kaori, why did you follow me?"

She said it without a hint of remorse, so I pressed my hand to my forehead and hung my head.

No good. This one's a tougher nut than I imagined. Ah... my head's going to hurt.

"...Do you even know what sexual consent is?"

"What's that? Planning a health education study session now?"

"...It's important, isn't it?"

"...You're so serious."

Seno-san placed her hand on my shoulder with a cheerful laugh.\
She pressed her weight down hard, and my back sank helplessly into the sofa.\
Without hesitation, she straddled my hips, narrowing her eyes with a smug grin as she looked down at me.\
I stared up in stunned silence as she rolled up the top she was wearing in one swift motion and tossed it aside.

　My gaze was riveted on her breasts, covered by cups adorned with white lace.

"Hey, were you even listening to me!?"

"I was listening. Just need to get your consent, right?"

I took several deep breaths. My heart pounded wildly, its frantic waves refusing to subside.\
Seno-san took my hand. I silently followed its movement with my eyes alone.

　The soft sensation pressed against mine. The definite weight felt in my palm. I gasped.

Looking down at me like that, Seno-san smiled defiantly.

"Hey, you really aren't going to do it?"

＊＊＊

　I pondered my defeat.\
In a word, I’d lost to my heart.\
A crushing defeat. Damn it.

Perhaps this woman was far simpler than I’d thought, a super-grade hedonist.\
And I was a fool to be led on by such a woman. Why had I followed her so willingly?\
I should have seen this coming...

“Kaori, you were straight, weren’t you?”

　Lying completely naked on the bed, Seno-san asked me something utterly outrageous with the casualness of someone addressing a colleague sitting across a desk.

"‘Was’? I still am."

When I spat it out like that, she gave a meaningful smile and said, "Hmm, I see."

I get what she’s implying. The fact that I’m sleeping with a woman makes my argument seem rather weak.\
　But honestly, the desire not to admit it occupied most of my mind.

"And what about you, then?"

"What do you mean?"

"Do you like women? Didn't you say you wanted to marry a rich man?"

"I don't particularly care either way."

"Oh..."

Right, that explains it. This woman can go either way, with men or women.\
　Hearing that, I recalled the welcome party held in spring.

She wasn't the type to be overly friendly with everyone. Even when we first met, her greeting had been rather curt.

Yet, when the president came over to our table at the welcome party, Seno-san was being unusually chatty and friendly, which I found odd.

After all, the president of this company we work for is a woman.

　It seemed Seno-san's true feelings were that if she could get away with it, she wanted to.\
Though apparently the president wasn't interested...

It's a simple question, but why did this woman want to sleep with me?\
Unlike the president, I don't have any money.

The more I thought about it, the more mysteries piled up.

This woman isn't stupid. She's the type who handles her work meticulously, prioritising accuracy over speed. The type to cross the bridge only after thoroughly checking it.

So why would such a woman take the risk of sleeping with a colleague? It could have made her position at the company awkward, even impossible.

Suddenly, as I sat on the edge of the bed to get dressed, something traced the middle of my back. Startled, I turned around to find Seno-san laughing as she poked my back with her toe.

　What on earth is this girl doing, sitting there starkers?

"Give it a rest, will you... It's rude. Honestly, why not put some knickers on? You can't stay naked forever."

"Nah, too much faff. Honestly, I'm sweaty and gross. How can you even stand wearing clothes?"

"Then why not have a shower? This is your place, after all."

"Nah. I'm knackered. I'm just going to sleep like this."

Unlike me, who wants to get dressed the moment something's over, she disliked putting clothes on.

Before getting into this bed, Seno-san slipped her hand through the gap in my knit top, cheerfully pulling it up and forcing me to strip.

I could have resisted, but this woman seemed to take pleasure in my reluctance. Realising that, I couldn't bring myself to say 'no' and meekly accepted it.

　It was stubbornness, really. I didn't like being dominated by this woman. Probably just that.

I glanced at the wall clock. It was already late at night.

As I picked up the discarded clothes from under the bed to get dressed, Seno-san stifled a yawn and said to me in a listless voice.

"Shall I lend you some nightwear?"

"No, I'm leaving now."

"Aren't you tired of going home now? You could just go back tomorrow."

You might be able to act perfectly normal come tomorrow morning, but I'm not.

A wave of intense regret began to wash over me for stepping into the same trap again.\
Even if I went home now, this regret wouldn't disappear, and it was too late.\
But it felt far better than facing the morning sun with this woman tomorrow.

　Just as I thought that and tried to pull the T-shirt over my head, Seno-san's white hand shot out and grabbed my clothes. Startled, I looked at her, and her dark brown eyes narrowed sharply.

"Kaori, you know, don't people often say you're not exactly charming?"

"...It's rather odd to expect charm from me, isn't it?"

　Returning her snide remark with one of my own, Seno-san chuckled oddly, "True enough."

"It's alright, just stay the night. I'll make you breakfast tomorrow morning."

Breakfast.

I flung the clothes I was holding back under the bed.\
It was certainly hot outside, and calling a taxi to go home now seemed like a faff. Preparing breakfast myself tomorrow morning sounded utterly dreadful.

"Right then... lend me some loungewear."

When I said it bluntly like that, Seno-san, still lying down, pointed towards the wardrobe with her glossy red-painted toes and declared, "Help yourself to whatever you like."

I rummaged through the wardrobe without hesitation, as instructed. Then, a distinctly masculine grey sweatshirt emerged, and I gave a wry smile.

Just how many people does this woman have this kind of relationship with?

"Is this your boyfriend's? Can I wear it?"

I turned around and said it sarcastically.\
She, who had been closing her eyes to sleep, opened them wide at my words and stared intently at the sweatshirt I held.

"...If it is my boyfriend's, wanting to wear it shows you've got some nerve."

"It's fine, isn't it? We're both women. I'll just say I borrowed it from a friend."

Without waiting for her answer on whether I could wear it, I slipped the large sweatshirt over my head.

"...Unfortunately, I don't have a boyfriend. That's my ex's. Take it off tomorrow morning and chuck it in the bin."

"Hmm..."

She rolled over naked, making space for one person beside her. I returned to the bed without a word, then peered up at the shelf above.

"Hey... what are you doing?"

"Well? It's my first time visiting a girl like you, so I was wondering if you keep things like condoms around all the time."

I'd meant it as a simple question, but Seno-san clearly frowned in annoyance, then kicked my thigh hard.

"Ouch! Hey, what are you doing?!"

"You're the worst. Utterly lacking in tact. That's why you're so unpopular, Kaori!"

Seeing her clearly indignant expression finally made me feel satisfied, and I laughed. Pushing her pure white back aside, I lay down on the bed.

Then, turning my back on Seno-san who was muttering complaints beside me, I closed my eyes, my thoughts drifting to the next morning's breakfast.
