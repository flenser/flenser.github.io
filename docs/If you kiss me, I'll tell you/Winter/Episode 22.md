Episode 22: After Sleeping Together Just a Few Times

Only Manager Yamazato was in the meeting room. I tilted my head in confusion but pulled out a chair at the four-seater table and sat down next to Seno-san.

"Sorry I'm late."

"No, no. I'm sorry for calling you in so suddenly."

Manager Yamazato lowered her eyebrows apologetically.

"No... Shouldn't we call Arimura-chan too?"

　Wondering why, I asked. Manager Yamazato smiled and nodded.

"I wanted to speak to you two first. I'd appreciate it if this remained confidential for now, but actually..."

I listened intently as Manager Yamazato began.

To put it simply – the happy news was that Manager Yamazato was expecting her second child.

　She planned to take a year's maternity leave starting sometime before next summer.
And the reason she'd called us both in today was to ask Seno-san to fill the gap during her absence, not by bringing in a manager from another department, but by taking on the role of "sub-manager". She also wanted me to support her in that role...
Actually, they were also considering bringing in another new recruit in the spring.

"We'll start the handover process now... but come spring, I'd like to ask Mitsuya-san to take charge of training the new recruits. What do you think? I'd like to hear both your opinions before making a formal decision..."

"I have no objections to that arrangement. And Manager Yamazato, please don't hesitate to take time off if you're not feeling well."

It would be tough if Manager Yamazato were absent.
　But with Seno-san and myself, we should manage. Thinking this, I glanced over at him—Seno-san took a small breath and spoke softly.

"...I'm terribly sorry, but I must decline the assistant manager role. I simply cannot do it."

"Eh?"

I found myself exclaiming.

"...May I ask why you feel that way?"

Manager Yamazato, seated opposite, showed no hesitation. Smiling, she spoke calmly.

"I believe Mitsuya-san is better suited for it."

I was startled to hear my name mentioned so suddenly.

I understand feeling anxious about taking on a different role.
But having seen how Seno-san works, I know this girl is absolutely cut out for management.

　Manager Yamazato must have seen it too. That’s surely why she was chosen.

"Were you listening to Manager Yamazori? It’ll be fine. I’ll support you properly too..."

"That sort of thing... I’m not suited to it."

It should be a golden opportunity. Why would she suddenly turn it down?
If the ambitious Arimura-chan were here, she’d be furious, like a fire had been lit.

"Is that how you feel now, Seno-san?"

Manager Yamazato asked quietly.
Neither angry nor lecturing, just listening.
This is why she commands such respect. No wonder Arimura-chan adores her.

"Yes."

Seno-san answered without hesitation.

"I see... Hmm. Well then, Mitsuya-san, what do you think? Would you like to try being the assistant manager?"

Now that the question had been directed at me, I sat up straight.
What do I think? That's obvious.

"...No. Seno-san absolutely should do it."

＊＊＊

I chased after the swaying, long brown hair walking ahead of me.

"Wait a moment!"

Catching up in the corridor, I grabbed his arm and finally got Seno-san to stop.

"Why did you refuse? You absolutely should do it. Manager Yamazato was clearly troubled."

"I'll pass. If you say so, Kaori should do it."

"But you've been with the company longer, haven't you?"

"Only in terms of seniority. But you're the better fit. I'll support you, so take it on."

As if she had no intention of saying another word, Seno-san abruptly shook off my hand and strode off.

"Wait... listen to me!"

I couldn't understand it at all.

It wasn't a bad offer, I thought.
She said it was just for a year while Manager Yamazato was away, but gaining experience as deputy manager here could mean she'd be the obvious choice for manager in the next personnel reshuffle.

　She's obsessed with money, so why would she turn down a promotion? What on earth is he thinking?

Sure, the workload would get heavier and challenges would pile up, but I'd give her my full support.

We could absolutely do it. The two of us.
Am I the only one who thinks that?

Feeling frustrated about going straight back to my desk, I stopped by the break room for a coffee.
　Standing before the vending machine, I pressed the coffee button and swiped my ID card.
Truth be told, I wanted to go for a smoke, but if I left my desk too long, Arimura-chan would start nagging.

The coffee finished brewing, and I took the cup from the machine. Simultaneously, a notification chime sounded, and I pulled my phone from my pocket.

The screen showed it was from Niiyama-kun.

"What the hell now? This is a pain..."

　I tapped the notification.
Reading the message, I froze solid.

――Seno-san, she said she'd go on a date with me this Christmas!

"...Huh?"

I stared at my phone screen, utterly incredulous.

Christmas? She agreed? Seno-san?

It can't be true.
She was so reluctant before...

　I clenched my fists tightly.
I couldn't ignore the feeling welling up deep inside my chest. It felt like burning iron was being pressed against my heart.

After work, I hurriedly clocked out and rushed to catch up with Seno-san, who had already left the office.
I caught up with her at the entrance and walked beside her, meeting her dark brown eyes as she glared at me suspiciously.

"What is it? Sorry, I can't be bothered with you today. Not in the mood."

"That's not it. I have to go back to my parents' place for my sister's wedding too... No, that's not it either. I heard from Niiyama-kun. You're going on a date? You said you could 'choose your own partner'!"

Unable to control myself, I snapped at her accusingly. Seno-san glared at me.

"Choose what? It's just dinner. We're not actually dating or anything."

A Christmas date isn't just dinner.
My chest churned. It was unbearably unpleasant. Impatience. Doubt. All sorts of feelings swirled together like a dark hotpot, grinding and screaming deep inside me.

　—I really ought to find myself a boyfriend soon...

Those words back then. Could she actually be seriously considering going out with Niiyama-kun?

Could she possibly have a crush on... Niiyama-kun?

His family is loaded. He fits Seno-san's criteria perfectly. But.

"Don't do it. You two would never get along. Niiyama-kun was after Aosawa-chan the whole time before."

"I know. Actually, weren't you trying to set me up with Niiyama-san before? What's changed now?"

"Well, Niiyama-kun only has eyes for your face and body. You really should steer clear."

"...But that goes for you too, Kaori. You're only interested in my body, aren't you?"

A piercing glare. The bluntness of her words stung a little.

No, don't lump us together, the words rose to my throat, but I forced them back down. This wasn't the time for such a standoff.

"...Is ditching your assistant manager, dating rich men, and aiming for a fairy-tale marriage really what makes you happy? It'll all be over once you get divorced. Why do you insist on relying on men to get by? You've got the strength to stand on your own two feet, don't you?"

I'm just imposing my own desires on her.
It's only that I wish for Seno-san to be that way.
　How she chooses to live is her own business; I have no right to interfere. Even knowing that, I couldn't hold back.
Please, I begged her, don't wish for a life leaning on someone else when the chance to seize what you want with your own strength is right there.

"You're being persistent. It's none of your business, Kaori. Who I'm with or what I do."

Who I'm with, what I do.

Those words rubbed me the wrong way. I flew into a rage and couldn't stop myself from spitting out words of accusation.

"So you'll sleep with anyone for money? What's wrong with your sense of chastity? I just don't get it."

Seno-san's feet came to an abrupt halt. Startled, I stopped too. She spun around, grabbed me firmly by the collar, pulled me towards her, and my body jerked violently.

"Whoa!"

　Her gaze met mine, sharp as a bullet.

Huh? No way, am I about to get hit...?
Hold on, did this girl always have such a violent streak?
I instinctively squeezed my eyes shut, bracing for impact, but no fist came flying.

Instead,

"...What do you know about me? Don't talk like you understand. After just a few times sleeping together..."

　I gasped at the voice, quiet yet pregnant with anger I'd never heard before.

Seeing her genuinely angry for the first time, I was so overwhelmed by the sheer pressure I lost my words.

What do I do... she's really, really angry...

She shoved me in the chest, sending me stumbling. Without another glance at me, Seno-san walked away.

I roughly ran my fingers through my messy fringe.

　We've spent countless nights together since that summer. I've lost count of how many times we've done it. Yet to you, it's still "just a few times"?

I'd said it again...
Jealousy made me blurt out something I didn't mean.

My head knew I had to apologise, but I couldn't bring myself to chase after her any further.
