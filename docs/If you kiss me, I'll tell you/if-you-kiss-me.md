## Description

Don't be ridiculous. My pride won't allow me to be with you.

This is a spin-off of 'How About Afternoon Tea?'

Kaori Mitsuya is a 26-year-old working for a company in the hotel business.\
Drunk, she unwittingly ends up in a physical relationship with her colleague and arch-rival, Rei Seno, who is the same age.\
Meanwhile, she herself seems utterly unconcerned about having had a physical relationship with her...?

※ This is a workplace couple/friends with benefits/yuri story!!!!\
You'll probably enjoy it more if you read the main Afternoon Tea story first!
