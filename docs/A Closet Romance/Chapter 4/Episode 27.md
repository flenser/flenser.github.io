Episode 27: No Teasing Me for Fun!

After taking a slight detour to see the illuminations, we walked slowly back to my house, holding hands tightly the whole way.

"Is this Nana's house?"

"Yep, that's right. It's close to Mitsuki's house, isn't it?"

After all, it's in the perfect location — just a fifteen-minute walk away, so I can visit Mitsuki whenever I want to see her.\
　Opening the gate and stepping inside, Mitsuki surveyed the entire garden.

"Nana's house is big..."

"Eh, really?"

"Yeah, it feels like a rich person's house."

"It's not like that. Mum's a full-time housewife now..."

The houses in my neighbourhood are all quite similar, so I'd never really thought mine was that much bigger than the others.

"I wonder what Nana's room is like?"

"Don't get your hopes up, it's just ordinary..."

We opened the front door and stepped inside.

"Excuse us."

"Please come in."

Mitsuki neatly lined up her shoes – the formal version of her was cute.\
Usually, she was busy holding Tasuku, so she never had time to arrange her shoes properly. She'd just fling her trainers off in the hallway.\
　It felt rather novel, as I'd grown accustomed to arranging her discarded shoes while lining up my own loafers.

When I led her into the living room, my mother came out of the kitchen to greet Mitsuki.

"Welcome, Mitsuki-chan."

"I'm Kase Mitsuki. Pleased to meet you. Thank you for having us today. This is from my mother."

Looking slightly nervous, Mitsuki handed the paper bag to her mother.

"Oh, thank you for your thoughtfulness."

Her mother smiled warmly, clearly pleased, and I felt a little relieved.

"Wow, a Christmas tree! It's huge!"

Mitsuki gazed curiously at the tree towering in the corner of the room.\
Come to think of it, Mitsuki's house never had any Christmas decorations.\
Then again, she probably wouldn't have time for that; her mother seemed busy with work.

"Do you put it up every year?"

"Yes, Mum does. I just watch."

"Nana never helps at all. She just lazes around on the sofa all the time. This girl has never even washed a single plate. I'm really worried if she'll manage living alone in Tokyo."

"Eh?"

Mitsuki looked at me with a startled expression. Feeling rather embarrassed, I looked away.

"...But at our place, she always volunteers to wash the bottles?"

She whispered quietly, and I turned away. That... well, it's because it's for Mitsuki.\
Helping out at home... well, that'll come later.\
Once I'm away from home and realise how much my parents mean to me, I'll make up for it all at once.

　I always try to act all grown-up and cool, but it’s embarrassing that Mitsuki saw my childish side again.\
She poked my flushed cheek with her fingertip.

"No, no, you really must help Mum properly."

"I know, I will from now on... But right now I’m busy with my studies..."

Mitsuki laughed at my stammering reply.\
　If we acted like this, Mum would surely believe we were just close friends.\
She'd never dream that this girl was the one my daughter had secretly loved since her first year of high school.

The Christmas dinner Mum lovingly prepared was more lavish than anything I'd ever seen.\
I'd told her she didn't need to go to such lengths, yet the table was crammed with her homemade dishes.

"Eat while it's warm, dear."

"Wow, it looks delicious. Thank you."

"Please help yourself. If there's anything you don't like, you can leave it. Just eat what you enjoy."

"Thank you. But I don't dislike anything, so I'm fine."

Mitsuki smiled happily.\
Then Dad, who had slowly made his way from the sofa to the dining table, smiled broadly and looked at my face.

"Nana has so many things she dislikes and absolutely only eats what she likes. Even though they're the same age, they're quite different, aren't they? Mitsuki-chan is very grown-up."

"Nana, do you really dislike that many things?"

"No, not really... it's not like I dislike that many things..."

"Plenty, isn't she? She hates peppers, aubergines, tomatoes... this child still can't eat anything but mild curry."

Stop it, Mum, don't ruin my image any further! I wanted to say, but I didn't want to argue and make things worse, so I just kept quiet and tucked into my chicken.

Mitsuki, sitting next to me, looked at me happily.

"Nana looks grown-up on the outside, but she's like a child inside. It's adorable, isn't it?"

Seeing me blush, Mitsuki grinned, looking unusually cheerful and just a tad mischievous.

We finished our meal in a pleasant atmosphere, polished off the cake for dessert, and then headed to my room to prepare for the bath.

"Excuse me! So this is Nana's room, eh?"

After opening the door and gesturing for her to come in, Mitsuki looked around my room.

"Pretty ordinary, isn't it?"

"Ah, there's a guitar."

My white electric guitar, untouched for ages and practically becoming part of the decor.\
Spotting it, its strings loose and covered in dust, Mitsuki walked over cheerfully.

"Can you play the guitar, Nana?"

"Not very well, but I can manage. I only started when a friend invited me to try it in secondary school."

"Oh, really?"

Suddenly, Mitsuki took my left hand, grabbed my fingers, and squished them.

"Huh, they're soft. Haven't you played at all lately?"

"...Mitsuki, how do you know finger tips get hard?"

"Eh? Hmm... Because Yamato played guitar too..."

"Hmm..."

Just as I thought. I knew it. Must be that rowdy, ex-delinquent boy's influence. Jealousy makes my facial muscles freeze.

"Nana asked, didn't she? Don't sulk."

"Whatever..."

Even if told not to sulk, I sulk anyway.\
I suppose I asked because I wondered, but still.

"Nanaa..."

Mitsuki hugged me tightly as I turned away.

"Cheer up, please."

I glare at Mitsuki, who clearly seems to be enjoying herself. She could have easily avoided the topic, but she must have deliberately mentioned Yamato's name knowing it would make me jealous.

"Mitsuki, you're mean. Or rather, calculating."

"Eh? I don't think so."

"You think if you cling to me like this and act cute, I'll forgive you for everything, don't you?"

"Won't you forgive me?"

"I will, but—"

I sighed, and Mitsuki laughed.\
Fine. She already knows I like her, so there's no point hiding it anymore.

"Mitsuki... why did you break up with Yamato-kun? You still seemed close just now."

"Hmm... do you want to know?"

"...I want to know."

"Hmm. You're curious even though you're planning to leave for Tokyo without me? You did say you wanted to find a girlfriend, though."

Mitsuki's eyes sparkled.\
Ugh, I feel like she's seen through me. That I'm starting to have slight doubts about going to Tokyo.\
Mitsuki really has sharp instincts. Like how she saw through my feelings for her. That sharpness and cunningness are talents.

　If she ever got involved in sugar daddy arrangements, she'd probably fleece wealthy older men out of a fortune.\
I'm glad you grew up properly, Mitsuki. I sincerely hope you continue to live in an environment where you never have to resort to such unscrupulous behaviour.\
There's something unsettling about her – the way she seems utterly capable of offering herself up the moment it suits her interests. Mitsuki is frightening.

"...It's only natural to be a bit preoccupied with your ex, isn't it? After all, I do like Mitsuki."

"Hehe, that's right. Nana adores me, doesn't she?"

"...Mitsuki's been rather mean today, hasn't she?"

"I just wanted to confirm how you feel and feel reassured, sorry. It's just that you keep saying you want a girlfriend..."

Just wanting reassurance, huh.\
　It feels a bit like wanting to put a collar on your pet dog to stop it running away, that sort of thing. Not that it matters, though. Even if I am being treated like a dog. Woof woof.

"And about Yamato... well, I was just borrowing his authority a little."

"Borrowing his authority?"

"Yeah, this rather persistent senior had taken a shine to me... so to turn him down, I asked my childhood friend Yamato to play along. Then Yamato took it seriously, and somehow, I couldn't back out..."

"Blimey, that's awful..."

"...Yeah, I know. I think so too. I'm really regretting it now."

Not only the audacity to do that in middle school, but the natural skill to manipulate men and use them conveniently is worthy of admiration...

　But does that mean she'd do the same to me?\
Ugh, the more I learn, the scarier Mitsuki gets. It makes my spine freeze.

Noticing my stiffened expression, Mitsuki pressed her face against the nape of my neck, rubbing it as if testing my mood.

Ah, cute. Just like a cat.\
I could feel my IQ visibly plummeting.

"Hey Nana, I know this isn't much of an apology for making you jealous..."

"Hm?"

"...Want to take a bath together?"

Whispered in that sweet voice, I instinctively grabbed Mitsuki's shoulders and pushed her away.

"No way am I going in with you! What are you thinking? Like I'd ever do that!?"

"Why not? You've already seen me naked! Nana, you're so boring."

"Enough! Stop teasing me! Go and get in the bath already!"

"Hehe, alrighty then."

As if it really had been a joke, Mitsuki smoothly let go of me, opened her rucksack, and rummaged for her change of clothes.

I slumped down onto the bed.

　A complex mix of relief that it was a joke and disappointment...

You devil! What do you take people's feelings for?! I wanted to say, but when I turned around, Mitsuki just gave me a bright smile and my own lips naturally curved upwards.

Because Mitsuki is just so cute. I'm done for, completely played and buzzing.

"Hey, Nana. I bought some new underwear, look. Is this your style?"

　When Mitsuki showed me the straps of a pink bra adorned with distinctly girlish lace, I instinctively threw a cushion at her.

"Hey, I told you to hurry up and take a bath! You idiot, Mitsuki!"

"Eek! Nana's angry!"

Mitsuki giggled happily. Not wanting her to see my bright red face, I flopped face-first onto the bed.
