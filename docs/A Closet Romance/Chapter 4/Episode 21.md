When I was a child, I feel like it snowed more in winter.

We couldn't build snow huts, of course, but we could make small snowmen.\
Nowadays, though, even when it snows, it doesn't settle much. It melts quickly everywhere except in the shade.\
　I hate this slushy, muddy snow mixed with water – it’s sticky and filthy.\
It’s such a faff scraping the mud off my loafers too.

“Phew… It’s bloody freezing, isn’t it? Are you alright bare-legged, Nana? You should wear tights.”

Mizuki, walking beside me, exhaled white breath, rubbed her hands together, and glanced at me.

"Tights with a uniform are a bit of a cop-out. But honestly, my legs are freezing stiff —I've lost all feeling in my thighs."

Mizuki, wearing a white down jacket over her uniform, looked even cuter all bundled up.

"Your thighs are red! You're a student preparing for exams —don't catch a cold."

"You look colder than me. Here, have my scarf."

I wrapped the scarf around my neck around her own, twisting it snugly.\
It was a shame to hide her cheeks, reddened by the cold, but I hated the thought of her suffering.\
After I’d wrapped my scarf around her, she quietly narrowed her eyes and smiled.

"Thanks. Nana, you really are kind."

"...Well, I suppose."

"It's because you like me, right? That's why you're being extra nice?"

"...Honestly, you've become quite cheeky, Mizuki."

To hide my embarrassment, I nudged her arm with my elbow.

It was pointless now that my feelings were out in the open. I couldn't take them back, nor did I want to.\
　But when she said it like this, all smiles and happy, my cheeks threatened to relax.\
It felt like Mizuki was affirming my feelings.

Since then, Mizuki occasionally started acting in ways that seemed to test my feelings.\
Like casually touching my hand in passing moments, or that look that clearly tried to probe me.

I knew these actions weren't driven by romantic feelings towards me.

　Mizuki depends on me.\
I... know this, and I'm starting to find comfort in this current relationship.\
I never knew being needed and relied upon by someone you like could be so deeply satisfying.

I fear I might become dependent on this sweet relationship myself.\
The angel and devil inside me are locked in a constant, brawling fight.

　For instance, if Mizuki became even more dependent on me, if she couldn't live without me —what name should we give to that kind of relationship?

What's the difference between dependency and romantic feelings?

Hey, Mizuki, I'm scared out of my wits.\
When this spell breaks, what kind of look will Mizuki give me?

　After picking up Tasuku together, we headed to Mizuki's place as usual.\
Born in January, Tasuku will be one next month already.\
When I first met him, he was four months old – a proper baby.\
But now, on those short legs, he wobbles but stands firmly.

　Children grow at such a pace.\
Thanks to Tasuku settling down and sleeping more consistently, Mizuki has become remarkably more energetic.\
But as Tasuku requires less attention, it means Mizuki needs me less... It should be a joyful thing, yet to be honest, it feels a little lonely.

When we arrived at Mizuki's flat, an unfamiliar high school boy stood before the door.\
　His hair, stiff with wax, stood spiky and pointed skywards. His thin, over-plucked eyebrows and sharp gaze gave off a rather rowdy vibe.\
Hands stuffed into the pockets of his baggy uniform, he raised just one hand lightly towards Mizuki.\
A bad feeling washed over me, and I furrowed my brow.

"Oi."

"Yamato here. What's up?"

Mizuki tilted her head and asked.\
Yamato?\
The uncharacteristically intimate atmosphere made her heart burn with a sharp, stinging ache.

"Mizuki, didn't you see my message? I came to return the reference book."

Mizuki?\
Just now, this bloke called her by her first name.\
Not logic, but a woman's intuition was screaming this bloke was the enemy.

"Sorry, I was picking up Tasuku, so I didn't notice."

"This stuff's a bit tricky, I couldn't really get it. Got anything better?"

"Eh? This is the easiest one. Hey Yamato, are you actually studying for the entrance exams?"

"Not at all. Well... it'll be fine. I'll get into somewhere!"

　His grin was carefree, and he didn't seem as bad as he looked. Though he looked fatally stupid.\
Why on earth was Mizuki acquainted with such a daft-looking lad?

"Nana, let me introduce you. This is Yamato, my childhood friend."

"Hi."

"Pleased to meet you, I'm Asami Nana."

After the brief introductions, Yamato grinned widely, showing his teeth.

"Nana-chan, you're super cute. Let's all hang out sometime."

"No way! Absolutely not! Nana's studying for exams, she doesn't have time to hang out with Yamato!"

Mizuki hurriedly stepped between me and Yamato, touching his shoulder to push him back.\
In that instant, I could feel the flames of jealousy roaring up inside me.

"What's this? Aren't you two playing right now?"

"We're about to study together. Yamato, you should go home now. Besides, I don't have any more easy reference books. Buy your own."

"Eh? I don't know what to buy! Ah, I get it. Then let's study together, the three of us!"

"No way!! Why don't you just buy some maths drills on Amazon? Tasuku's got a cold, so I really need to get inside now. Bye then, Yamato. See ya!"

She gave Yamato's broad back a firm shove to urge him on his way, then Mizuki grabbed my hand, pulled me inside, and slammed the door shut.

"Phew... Sorry, Yamato's not as bad as he looks, though..."

"...That ex-boyfriend you mentioned before, the one you went to see fireworks with? Was that Yamato-kun?"

"Eh... How did you know?"

"...Just somehow."

I knew it. They seemed unusually close, so I suspected it.\
Mizuki's ex-boyfriend... was a spiky-haired punk after all. I'd assumed he was a proper lad, but he turned out to be such a wild one. He looks like a proper punk from every angle.

I had far too many questions I wanted to ask – why she's still on good terms with her ex, whether they kissed even if she said they never had sex.

　But I couldn't ask. Knowing the answers terrified me to death. I realised my facial muscles were dying from desperately suppressing my emotions, but I couldn't put on a brave face.

"...Nana, are you angry?"

After taking Tasuku out of the baby carrier, Mizuki lowered her eyebrows, as if gauging my mood.\
I silently placed my school bag on the floor, then sat down hugging my knees.

"...I'm not angry."

It's true I wasn't angry.\
I was just depressed. It was unbearably painful to be confronted with the fact that Mizuki was straight.

If I'd been a boy, Mizuki would absolutely have been my girlfriend.\
I reckon I'd be pretty decent. Not to brag, but I'm tall – if I were a boy, I'd definitely be at least 180 centimetres.\
　I'm reasonably smart too, I reckon I'd be a good match for Mizuki. Far better than some ex-delinquent like that.

The younger me couldn't hide my feelings. I couldn't do it as well as Mizuki.

The bottom line is, I'm sulking fiercely right now.\
As if noticing this, Mizuki came up behind me, wrapped her arms around my back, and hugged me tightly.

"Nana, I'm sorry."

"...You don't need to apologise, Mizuki."

"Then why are you sulking so much?"

I glared at Mizuki as she poked my cheek with her index finger.\
Of course I'm sulking. I didn't want to see Mizuki's ex-boyfriend.\
When I abruptly looked away, Mizuki smiled softly and suddenly pressed her lips against my cheek.

"Mizuki!?"

"Hehe, Nana, your face is bright red."

"Tasuku's watching!"

"It's alright."

She hurriedly turned her gaze towards Tasuku. Finally freed from the baby carrier, Tasuku was sitting quietly, playing with his toys. She breathed a sigh of relief.

"Cheer up, Nana. If a cheek isn't enough, I'll give you a kiss on the lips. Come on, look this way, kiss."

"Fine, Mizuki! Stop it, I'm not angry!"

I pushed Mizuki's shoulder in a fluster, and she burst out laughing.\
Knowing I like her and teasing me like this is cruel.

　Before I could protest, she threw herself mercilessly into my chest, pressing her ear against my breast.\
Realising she was trying to listen to my heartbeat, I tried to pull away, but she pinned me down firmly, her weight crushing me. Unable to support her, I fell backwards.

"Ouch!"

"Nana really does like me, doesn't she? Your heart's pounding so hard. Listening to it makes me feel safe, like Nana's telling me she loves me."

My heart thundered like an explosion, beating so wildly I couldn't control it no matter how hard I tried.

"Haa... Oh, come on... I never thought you'd have such a nasty streak, Mizuki."

I wanted to bury my face in my hands. How did it come to this...?\
When I snapped at her, Mizuki just laughed and pressed her cheek even harder against my chest.

"If I do things like this, will Nana end up disliking me?"

"...You know I can't dislike you, don't you?"

"Hmm, I see. So you can't dislike me."

Please don't say it with such an innocent smile, looking so pleased. ...You're too cute, really.

"Hey Nana, please keep liking me forever. Shall we go to the same university? Then you can do whatever you like with me. Come stay over again. Tasuku sleeps longer these days... Next time, he definitely won't wake up."

Mizuki whispered this, touching my lips with her index finger.\
A flood of thoughts rushed through my mind, making my face flush hot. Trying to hide my flustered state, I turned my face away and looked at Tasuku.

"...Tasuku —did you hear that? Your sister's a proper vixen, isn't she..."

I called out to Tasuku as if seeking refuge.

Whether he understood the situation or not, my saviour glanced back at us embracing and smiled like an angel —suddenly, guilt washed over me for being affectionate in front of Tasuku. I hurriedly pushed Mizuki's shoulder.
