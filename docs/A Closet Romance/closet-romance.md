## Original Title

とあるクローゼットの恋の話

## Description

I'll make sure Nana says she absolutely never wants to leave Mizuki's side.
Asami Nana is a third-year high school student. She looks a bit flashy, just your average ordinary schoolgirl, but in reality, she's a closeted lesbian who's never dated anyone.
She's been secretly in love with Kase Mizuki, who's been top of the year since they started school, since their first year.

A crush on a straight girl could never be reciprocated.
There was absolutely no chance she'd ever notice me.
So I'd keep this love hidden, cherishing it silently.
I'd leave my hometown soon, go to university in Tokyo, find a cute girlfriend who was also gay like me, and forget about Kase Mizuki.
That's what I thought, anyway. But then an unexpected turn of events brought me suddenly close to Mizuki, the girl I'd been pining for all this time?

This is the story of a lesbian high schooler utterly swept along by a straight girl who plays hard to get. 🫶
