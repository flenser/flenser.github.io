Episode 2: Well, I Am a Top Student, After All

After school, the rain that had started in the afternoon dampened my spirits for playing before heading home. By the time I reached the station nearest my house, the sky was shrouded in even thicker clouds, turning gloomy, and the rain had intensified.

I don't like the rain.

　The humidity messes up my hair, and mud splashed up from my loafers leaves stains on my navy socks.\
I absolutely hate that tight, pulling sensation on my skin when the mud on my calves dries.

Ugh, walking home in the rain is such a drag. I really hate getting wet.
I'm just going home anyway.

　Normally I'd take the shortest route home, but the back alley I usually use has uneven paving where large puddles form.

It's a bit of a detour, but today I reckon taking the main road is the better bet.

With a pop, I opened my favourite umbrella and started walking out of the station. Large raindrops pelted mercilessly against the umbrella.

　The pedestrian signal at the main road junction turned red, and I stopped.\
The traffic here is heavy, so once the lights go red, it feels like an eternity. Every time I pass, I think they should just build a footbridge.\
Sighing, I glanced casually across the street and saw a girl in the same uniform as me, standing under an umbrella.\
Navy blue blazer.\
　Blue tie – a third-year like me.\
A checked pleated skirt, just long enough to barely cover her knees, and low-cut All Stars on her feet.\
In one hand, she held a tall, yellow-green bag. A large black rucksack was clutched in front of her chest.\
Why was she holding the rucksack in front? As I squinted to see better, I immediately realised it wasn't a rucksack.\
　It was a baby carrier. Short, tiny legs poked out from both sides.

That was... a baby?

"...Eh, seriously...?"

I instinctively looked at the girl's face, startled, and hastily hid my own face with my umbrella.

It's alright, she still shouldn't have noticed me.

My heart began pounding wildly, its rhythm accelerating sharply.

　Please, let this be a mistake on my part.\
I want to believe that, but there's no way I could mistake that face I've watched for so long.

Could it be... Kase Mitsuki...?

The rumour Maki told me flashed through my mind. The rumour that Kase Mitsuki has a child.

Was it true?

No, but that can't be.\
　She'd never once missed a day of school.\
Besides, she's so slender—if her stomach had shown even slightly, it would have been obvious immediately.

Then whose child is that little one...?

Tentatively, I lifted the umbrella just a little.\
Standing on the other side of the intersection, it was indeed... Mitsuki Kase herself, her face pale and her head bowed.

I strained my eyes to observe her.\
　The large yellow-green bag she held had a baby's photo printed on it. It seemed to be a pack of nappies.

Hanging from the elbow holding the umbrella were two large plastic bags, digging painfully into her slender arms.\
There was a chemist just around the corner a little further on. Had she perhaps been shopping there?

Even from a distance, with her head bowed, she looked utterly exhausted.

　Hmm...\
It didn't seem like the face a blossoming high school girl should have. Her expressionless face, swaying on the commuter train like an early-morning salaryman, lacked any vitality.

The pedestrian signal turned green.\
From the other side, Kase Mitsuki approached at a slow pace.

Her gait was slightly awkward.\
With her slender frame carrying a baby, one couldn't help but wonder if she'd bought a bit too much.

She reached the middle of the crossing.\
Just as we were about to pass each other, Kase Mitsuki stumbled slightly—and I instinctively grabbed her arm to steady her.

"Are you alright?"

"Ah... Asami Asami-san?"

Our eyes locked, meeting with startled, wide, cat-like eyes.\
Ah, finally.\
Finally, she saw me.

"...It's raining, and with all this shopping, it must be heavy for one person. Do you live nearby? I'll carry it for you."

I deliberately avoided mentioning the baby cradled in the sling against her chest.\
Ignoring the momentary look of hesitation, I snatched the shopping bags from her hands.

"It's alright, Asami-san. My place is just around the corner."

"If it's close, there's no need to be so polite. My place is close too, so it's fine. Come on, let's go—the lights are about to turn red."

The lights flashed and beeped. I turned back midway across the crossing and retraced my steps.\
Kasemi Tsukasa, her shopping bags snatched away, followed me with a look of confusion.

Just as we finished crossing, the lights turned red. I turned to face her.

"Which way's your house?"

"...Asami-san, you're kind. Thank you."

"Well, I suppose I am a model student."

With my long brown hair curled at the ends, piercings in both ears, and my uniform worn casually, I certainly didn't look the part of a model student from any angle. But Kase Mitsuki didn't particularly point that out; she just gave a wry smile.

　Your fake smile is rubbish. But cute.

"...More importantly, Kase-san, you knew my name. That surprised me."

It wasn't strange that she knew my name since we were in the same class, but I never imagined the day would come when Kase Mitsuki would properly call me "Asami-san" by my surname.

"Of course I know you, Asami-san. You're very noticeable. But this is the first time we've spoken, right?"

"...Is that so?"

No, it wasn't the first time.\
We spoke on the day of the entrance ceremony, just a little bit.\
You might not remember, though.\
I murmured this silently to myself and began walking in step with Kase Mitsuki.

The weight of the plastic bag digging into my palm. Why on earth did she buy so much alone?

There were mountains of things I wanted to ask. But there must be things you don't want to be asked. Thinking that, I just kept walking in silence.

"...Asami-san, you're not going to ask anything, are you?"

Her eyes studied me, as if gauging my expression.\
She looked like she didn't know whether I was friend or foe.\
Like a highly wary cat. I could almost see the hairs on her back standing on end.

I wouldn't eat her or anything, but does she find me scary?\
　Come to think of it, I suppose so. I know it sounds like I'm bragging, but I am rather flashy-looking. And being tall probably makes me seem intimidating.

"...Actually, is it alright if I ask?"

"Yeah. Go ahead, ask. I'd rather not be misunderstood."

Seeing her gaze, as if she'd made up her mind, the tension eased slightly from my shoulders.\
I shifted my gaze to the baby sleeping peacefully, snoring softly, nestled against her chest.\
　Plump cheeks, perfectly round like snow-view daifuku mochi. Sleeping soundly with such a contented expression.\
Those long lashes... I couldn't help but think they bore a faint resemblance to Kase Mitsuki's.

Noticing my gaze shift to the baby, I could sense her breath catch ever so slightly.\
I peered into her dark eyes, now positioned lower than my own.

"...Did you really need to buy so much on a rainy day like this? Was it a special sale today?"

Caught off guard by the unexpected question, Kase Mitsuki's eyes widened in surprise.

Is it really that surprising?\
But I won't ask. Not if it's something you don't want to talk about.

I've no intention of telling anyone.\
Because I harbour not a shred of hostility towards you.

　All along, I wanted you to see me with those eyes.\
Kase Mitsuki, who used to just stare at me one-sidedly, is now beside me, talking to me.\
That fact alone has me wildly elated.

Because I thought time would just pass with us having no connection, and we'd graduate.

I'd given up. I just quietly, but constantly, held onto my feelings.

　My secret, one I could tell no one.\
Me, secretly imagining a romance with this girl.

I thought this secret would remain untold, my true feelings locked away, and this first love would wither and fade.
