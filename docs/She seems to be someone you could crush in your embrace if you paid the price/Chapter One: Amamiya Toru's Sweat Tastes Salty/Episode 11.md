"Mashiro, are you free after school today?"

It was three days after we'd established our arrangement that Amamiya Tōru extended that second invitation.
　For several days after that, we'd continued exchanging "good mornings" in the mornings and "goodbyes" when leaving, but no request for money had come, leaving me a little uneasy.
Even though I knew it probably wasn't the case, I couldn't quite shake off that tiny, few-percent chance that she might just be toying with me.

　So, truth be told, I find myself relieved that Amamiya Tōru has invited me out again today.

"I'm free."

I almost asked, "Are we going to the hotel again?" but gently closed my mouth instead.
It was lunchtime, and we were standing in front of the women's toilets in the less crowded annexe.
Knowing no one else was around, I responded to her conversation normally.
　But there was no guarantee no one would pass by, so I avoided anything that could get us into trouble if overheard. She, however, seemed intent on discussing this sensitive matter right here, completely disregarding my caution as she got straight to the point.

"Got any money on you?"
"I've got ten thousand yen I can use straight away."
"Right. ...By the way, besides that ten thousand, do you have any other money available today?"
"Is that not enough?"
"If we go to that hotel we visited last time, I'd like you to pay for that separately."
"...I see. The hotel fee was five thousand yen and a bit, wasn't it?"
"Yes."

Should I ask?

Is she struggling financially?

Of course, she'd been in this kind of financial arrangement with former night workers even before our relationship began. I imagine she has circumstances requiring her to gather money.
　But just a few days ago, I happened to glimpse her purse, and it contained several ten-thousand-yen notes.
Had she lost all that in just the last three days?
Hard to believe on the face of it.

Still, as someone buying her time and freedom, I didn't really object to covering the hotel costs too.

"Understood. I'll cover the hotel, and separately, I'll give you ten thousand yen, Amamiya-san."
"Really? Thank you."
"I can expect a suitable return for that, right?"

Amamiya Tōru made a face.
It was a smile that flushed her cheeks, one so captivating that even I, who understood it was natural and calculated, found myself mesmerised.
It was what people commonly call a "blushing smile".

"Sure. ………I wore the underwear I wanted to show you today, Mashiro-chan ♡"

　Her eyes looked up at me, as if she thought people were easily manipulated.
Such a teasing invitation, almost mocking.
But when someone as beautiful as Amamiya Tōru, loosening her uniform ribbon while leaning forward, said something like that, it was inevitable that I, harbouring feelings for her regardless of their nature, would become flustered.
I was certain that if things continued like this, I wouldn't be able to concentrate during fifth and sixth period classes, my face remaining crimson the whole time.

　But my fluster didn't last long.

The glimpse of her chest revealed when she loosened her ribbon.
The underwear I caught a glimpse of there was plain grey, bought at Shimamura, and decidedly unattractive.

I felt my composure return with a sharp snap.

I made a decision.

Today, as payback, we'd go shopping instead of a hotel.

　◇

"What on earth is that underwear? You said you'd wear something you wanted me to see, but it's not cute at all. Are you all talk? You, of all people, Amamiya Tōru?"

I was driven by a sense of mission.
It would have been unthinkable under normal circumstances, but at that moment, this sense of mission occupied one hundred percent of my brain.
So, without a trace of embarrassment, after school, I was heading towards the station, dragging Amamiya Tōru by the hand to go to the shopping mall.

　Amidst this, Amamiya Tōru, her hand being pulled along, sulked expressionlessly.
Yes, it's important enough to say again.

Amamiya Tōru was sulking.
Without a doubt. Definitely.
Her expression remained as transparent as ever, making it hard to tell what she was thinking just by looking at her.
But it was clear she was sulking in response to my nagging earlier.

"I never said I'd come wearing something cute."
"So you wanted me to see you wearing unattractive underwear?"
"………Who cares about underwear? It's just fabric coverage, right? More skin showing is better, isn't it? Am I wrong?"
"You're absolutely wrong. That remark is downright condescending."
"………Yeah. Makes no sense."

　The grip on my hand tightened.
Perhaps realising she couldn't argue back with words, she squeezed my hand repeatedly, pouting adorably.
Despite her expressionless face, every word and action radiated cuteness from Amamiya Tōru right now.

Her attitude felt refreshing, making me want to tease her just a little more.

"How adorable. Choosing your words based solely on second-hand knowledge leads to embarrassing mishaps like this."
"………I don't think it's embarrassing or anything."
"You say that, but you were confidently tempting me, even adding a ♡ at the end of your sentences."
"………Forget it. I don't know any Mashiro."

Saying that, Amamiya Tōru squeezed my hand one last time, so tightly it hurt, then released it and stepped in front of me, who had been leading the way.

"If you're going to say that, then you'll choose some cute underwear for me that suits me, won't you?"
"Of course. That's the intention."
"Hmm, well then, I suppose we'll see what you can do."
"Yes. Please look forward to it. I'll find you some absolutely adorable underwear that suits you perfectly, Amamiya-san."

Amamiya Tōru, who had let go before, grabbed my hand again.
And unlike before, now I was being led by her.

　We boarded the train, still holding hands.
