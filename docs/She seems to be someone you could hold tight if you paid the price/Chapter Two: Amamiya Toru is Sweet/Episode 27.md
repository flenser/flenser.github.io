Mashiro, pinned beneath me, desperately clinging on, sticking out her tongue, begging for a kiss.\
Before I knew it, I was kneading Mashiro's breasts while becoming utterly consumed with violating her mouth.

　Words overflowed.\
Mashiro said, "I like you."\
Those words carried more heat than I'd ever felt before.\
Like, like, feels good, like.\
Each time she whispered those words to me between kisses, heat settled within my own body, and my mind began to tingle and crackle.

"Say it too, Amamiya-san. Please. Say you like me."

　With tears welling.\
With drool trickling.\
With cheeks flushed.

The affection directed at me from her entire being.\
Urges me to change. Pushes me forward, telling me to take that step.

"Mashiro, Mashiro, Mashiro!"

What is the name of this feeling?\
It shifts with her actions, becoming a dark mist or a warm, white light.\
　And above all, the name of this feeling that desperately craves warmth.

I bite her soft, moist lips.\
I entwine her tongue, which continues to seek me with such tenderness.

To the sensation. To desire. And then.

I drown in Mashiro.

"I like you. I love you too, Mashiro!"\
"Uwaahh...! Mmm..."

　For the first time, I uttered the words "I love you" from the depths of my heart.\
Just voicing them aloud.\
Made my heart feel so light, as if it had dropped, and gave me such a refreshing feeling.

Responding to my words, Mashiro's body trembled even more violently.\
Twitching, desperately trying to suppress her voice, yet the moans that escaped were so lustrous.\
My lower abdomen ached.\
Never before had I wanted to become one with Mashiro so intensely.

"I like you too,"

she murmurs, gazing at me with a completely lost expression.\
She tells me "I like you" over and over.\
I'm showered with words, many times more than the "I like you" I gave her.

The hand that had been kneading her breasts now traces downwards, caressing her chest, her navel, then her lower abdomen in turn.

　Her uniform skirt remains on.

I pressed my knee against her crotch.

"Mmm..."

I know nothing of technique.\
Yet instinct tells me what might make Mashiro writhe more.\
I try every method that comes to mind.

Each time I grind my knee against her, Mashiro lets out a cooing sound that seems to have a heart symbol at the end.

　My heartbeat quickened. My lower abdomen ached persistently.\
A thrill of sadistic pleasure sent shivers down my spine.

Man or woman.\
Frankly, gender didn't matter at all.\
Right now, I just wanted to be with Mashiro, crying out before me.\
The lust within me was utterly uncontrollable; my instincts raged, screaming "I want to do it here".

　My hand slid beneath her skirt.

"Mashiro, it's alright, isn't it?"

She nodded quietly, yes.\
It seemed she couldn't wait any longer either.\
All we could think about was wanting to feel good with each other.

And yet.

How terribly ill-timed. Just as my fingertips were about to touch her private parts through her underwear, the infirmary door opened.

"Huh? The nurse isn't here."\
"Oh, it says on the whiteboard she's not in."\
"Right. Well, let's just help ourselves to the disinfectant and gauze then."\
"I really hate PE."\
"You're just too clumsy."

The voices of unfamiliar students echoed through the quiet space.

　We kept our voices hushed the entire time.

"Thank you very much!"

The students, having properly completed their business and thanked the empty infirmary, departed.\
I exhaled the breath I'd been holding.\
I looked at Mashiro.\
Mashiro looked back at me, looking slightly awkward too.

……….

We'd both completely regained our composure; the mood from just moments ago had vanished into thin air.

"Um... well, shall we go to class now?"

Perhaps finding the silence awkward, Mashiro made the suggestion.\
To which I replied,

"Wouldn't it look suspicious if we both went? I'll skip it here."\
"I see..."\
"Yeah."

Mashiro closed the curtain and left the infirmary.\
I lay back on the bed, now a solitary space enclosed by the drawn curtain.

I placed my hand on my forehead.

"…It’s hot."

The heat still smouldered within me.\
This emotion I’d named was still very much alive.\
　...Yet why, I wonder.\
It feels awkward.\
The space between me and Mashiro, which had been so perfectly formed just moments ago, was unique, my ideal space, so to speak. Satisfied we'd reached it, I should have told Mashiro straight away that we could continue after school today.

Somehow, it just didn't feel like that kind of atmosphere.

　I'm certainly aware I was drowning in lust.\
She must have felt the same.\
Did she become awkward afterwards, realising how embarrassing the words she'd spoken were?\
That's how it feels.

Anyway, we both needed time to cool our heads.\
It's just that time is now. I want to believe that.

I can talk it over with Mashiro again after school today and decide what to do.

　I close my eyes.

"……………Ah."

I recall what day it is today.\
Thursday.\
It was the day we established our rule together – a day set aside by me, without any expectation of reciprocity, to respect her private time.

With this awkward atmosphere lingering, it seems a little time might pass.

Somehow, I feel uneasy.
