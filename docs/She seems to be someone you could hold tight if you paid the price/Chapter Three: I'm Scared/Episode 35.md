"First, let's have a bath, Amamiya-san."

Amamiya Tōru is in my house.\
Though the situation isn't ideal, with her now encroaching upon my private space, I feel a slight tingle of excitement regardless.

　My mother's reaction upon seeing her at the entrance, dressed in her blood-stained uniform.\
I put on a smile and dealt with her in front of Amamiya Tōru.\
We exchanged brief greetings, she responded, and we introduced ourselves to each other. But during that, my mother gave me a meaningful look.

Explain it to me later.

　Having clearly understood her intent, I am now urging Amamiya Tōru to take a bath.\
My father will be home from work soon.\
While Amamiya Tōru is bathing at our house, I want to explain the situation at her home.\
………I want to explain, but.

There is one problem.\
It's too trivial to even call it a problem, and compared to what happened to Amamiya Tōru just moments ago, it's an extremely gentle, happy problem.

　Just before entering the house, feeling embarrassed at the thought of my parents seeing me holding hands with Amamiya Tōru, I tried to let go of her hand.\
But the moment I loosened my grip, whether reflexively or not, Amamiya Tōru's hold on my hand tightened.\
I looked at her face, but her eyes were still vacant, her expression transparent.\
I couldn't tell if it was intentional.

　Then, while she exchanged greetings with my mother at the entrance, while climbing the stairs to my room, and even now standing outside my door.

We remained holding hands the entire time.

Several times during this brief period, I tried loosening my grip again.\
But the result was the same; unconsciously, Amamiya Tōru refused to let go of my hand.\
It felt as though she was physically resisting being separated from me.

　The transparent girl, who had completely suppressed her emotions, murmured as she looked at me.

"Is this... Mashiro's room?"

It seemed that, for Amamiya Tōru, my room held more interest than the bath.\
Even now, with her emotions largely dead, knowing she could still show interest in something brought me a little relief.

"Yes, it is. It's rather awkward standing around here, so shall we go in first?"\
"Mm."

We entered the room.\
Closing my bedroom door, we were alone.\
I tried loosening my grip on her hand again. This time, it slipped away easily.\
I observed Amamiya Tōru's expression. But nothing could be read from her transparent face. I concluded to myself that she probably sensed I wouldn't let go immediately now we were alone.

　Having left the room empty since morning, the heating wasn't on, of course. The lit room felt properly cold.

"Oh, well, it's cold, isn't it? Wait here. I've just turned the heating on, so it should warm up soon."

I placed the heating remote on the desk and told Amamiya Tōru this while taking off my down coat.\
But she tilted her head.

"………? Cold? Are you alright?"

Tō Amamiya was concerned for me.\
The digital clock on the table, which also displayed the room temperature, showed 11°C.\
There was no way it wasn't cold.

Then I remembered.\
Come to think of it, the last time I'd been inside her house, it had been just as cold as outside, despite being indoors.\
　Did her room even have air conditioning?\
If the very concept of heating didn't exist, Amamiya Tōru must have spent at least one winter there.

Could it be she no longer even possesses that sense?

Does she feel neither cold nor heat?

That couldn't be.\
I felt an overwhelming urge to deny it.

Because she once described me as warm.

I cast my down coat aside on the floor and asked her.\
Not caring about the dirt on her clothes or anything else.\
Right now, I was driven solely by the urge to confirm.

"Amamiya-san, shall we have a hug? It's been a while."\
"Eh?"

A faint colour seeped into her otherwise transparent form.\
It was the colour of bewilderment.

"Wh-why?"

She faltered for words.\
　Though her expression should have remained transparent, her body took a step closer to me. It gave me confidence that, in her heart, she accepted the hug.\
So I could proceed boldly.

"I want to hug you again, Amamiya-san."

"Not just a hug. A kiss too. And then, that thrilling pleasure again – the kind that makes even breathing feel like drowning."

"I want to savour it with you, Amamiya-san. I want to feel it."

I gaze into Amamiya Tōru's eyes.\
I don't look away.\
She doesn't look away either.\
But seeing her expressionless ears turning red, I can't help but think she's adorable.

And then I remember, after all.

　I like Amamiya Tōru.\
I still like her very much.

That's good.\
That this feeling hasn't changed.

"What about you, Amamiya-san?"

I hope she hasn't forgotten.\
I want her to still like me too.\
I wanted her to be allowed to keep that feeling.

"………"\
"………"

A long silence.

Amamiya Tōru looked away from me.

And then,

she spread her arms wide.\
That gesture of hers, one I'd seen so many times.

"Hmm"

That was all she uttered.\
For the two of us, that was enough.

　Amamiya Tōru and I, once more like this, our hands around each other's backs.

Recalling the warmth of each other's bodies.\
Recalling the softness.

My heart, which had been on the verge of breaking, began to mend once more.\
I hoped hers would too.\
For now, that was all I could wish for.
