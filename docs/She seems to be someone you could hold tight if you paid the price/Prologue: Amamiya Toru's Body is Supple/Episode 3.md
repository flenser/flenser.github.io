"Support me financially." Amamiya Tōru did indeed ask me that.\
Supporting her financially meant I would be giving her money.\
It was exactly the same role as her former night workers.

No, I think that from Amamiya Tōru's perspective, the woman Kuroda Mashiro was ultimately no different from those people.

　From her perspective, I liked Amamiya Tōru, and if there was affection there, if I seemed likely to be hooked. In other words, if I seemed tempted and swayed, then to her, I was nothing more than a cash cow.

"Of course, I don't expect you to support me without anything in return, right?"

Squish squish

"Hmph."

Amamiya Tōru grabbed my chest like an eagle, moving her fingertips in a lewd manner.

"You're the first person of the same sex I've ever asked to do this, and honestly, I'm not entirely sure what kind of reward would be fitting yet. But precisely because we're the same sex, there are things we understand, don't you think?"

For example—

Saying that, Amamiya Tōru grabbed my hand, still touching her chest, with both of her hands again and brought it up to her face.\
The sensation through my hand and the sensation through my own chest.\
　Feeling a slight emptiness as both sensations simultaneously withdrew, Amamiya Tōru smiled at me.

"You're naughty, Mashiro-chan."

Even though I knew the expression was feigned.\
At the word "naughty" spilling from Amamiya Tōru's lips, her cheeks flushed.\
I couldn't help but feel a forbidden sensation, forcing me to avert my eyes from her.

It was in that moment.

　A warm, damp sensation spread through the fingertips of my right hand, which she had seized.\
I was forced, almost against my will, to look directly into Amamiya Tōru's face once more.\
She was watching me.\
Tilting her head to the right, then to the left, she sent me sidelong glances.

While licking my fingers, as if to beg.\
　Watching Amamiya Tōru lick my fingers with a look of adoration, her eyes raised slightly.\
I felt aroused.\
A thrill ran through me.

As if she had read my inner thoughts, Amamiya Tōru smiled again.

"You really are a naughty one, aren't you?"

The thread of Amamiya Tōru's saliva connecting my finger, which she had licked, to her mouth as she spoke.\
　It glistened, slick and sticky, strangely sensual.

"What are you... doing?"

The words barely escaped my lips, raspy, yet my question reached her clearly.

"How is it? Pleased?"\
"Eh?"\
"This is your reward."

Amamiya Tōru pulled her mouth away from my finger.\
　With one final lick, taking in the entire slackened thread, she took a handkerchief from her uniform blazer pocket and gently, meticulously wiped my damp fingertips.

I stared at my hand, now free and able to move.\
The feel of Amamiya Tōru's tongue, its dampness, its warmth too.\
All of it was seared into my memory with vivid clarity.

………This is the reward.

　I swallowed hard.\
My pulse was racing. I was undoubtedly being forced to make a crucial choice right now.\
I should refuse. That was obvious. But this time spent with Amamiya Tōru felt almost like a whim on her part, and if I refused once, she and I would surely never interact again. She wouldn't give me another chance.\
I had that feeling.

　A once-in-a-lifetime choice, one that could determine the course of my entire future.

What if I let myself be dazzled by this immediate temptation and something irreversible happened?\
I kept thinking about it, agonising over it over and over.

"...Hmm. Still agonising? ...................................Girls really are a pain, aren't they? Well then, how about this?"

Amamiya Tōru didn't seem inclined to give me time to agonise.\
　Her temptations continued.\
What would she do next? Or rather, what would she spring on me?\
I watched her movements carefully, but this time, Amamiya Tōru simply approached me, arms outstretched, a slow smile spreading across her face.

And then she hugged me.

Her hand slid around my hips and stroked me.\
But that was all.\
Having braced myself, the contrast was stark.\
　As if to relax my tense body, I exhaled softly and then tried wrapping my arms around Amamiya Tōru's back too.\
But my momentary carelessness was shattered into pieces by the words she whispered into my ear next.

"I'm giving my first time to you, Mashiro-chan."

"Eh?"

My body began to tense up again.\
Her words were that shocking.

"You know? At school, they call me a slut, a nympho who'll spread her legs for anyone."\
"... ..."\
"But the truth is, I've never even shown my naked body to anyone."\
"... ..."\
"I'm pure. My body is still perfectly untouched."

Hey, do you want it? My body, and my love.
