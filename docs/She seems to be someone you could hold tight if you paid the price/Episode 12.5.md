『Chapter 12.5: Pastel Pink, Sheer Fabric, and Cat Ears』

Mashiro entered the lingerie shop and immediately began browsing.
Holding my hand, she was filled with pointless enthusiasm, while I, seemingly uninterested, merely glanced at the underwear around us and the loungewear folded here and there.
　I had no particular intention of saying any of this was good.
Fundamentally, this time was bought by Mashiro, and I had virtually no right to say anything. So, I intended to remain silent and simply watch how things unfolded.

However, the one thing that happened to catch my eye, I couldn't look away from.

"...Cute."

The words slipped out unconsciously.
Mashiro picked up on it.

"Eh? Was there some underwear that caught your eye, Amamiya-san?"

Masahiro stopped walking.
Then, following my silent gaze, she looked in the same direction.

"This, is it?"

She pointed at it.

The folded, fluffy loungewear.
Perhaps a popular item, a mannequin wearing it stood beside it.
　A white mannequin wearing a hood. The hood of that fluffy loungewear had cat ears attached.

"It is rather cute, but you came to choose underwear today, didn't you, Amamiya-san?"
"...I know. I never said I wanted it."
"I see."

Then the conversation ended, and Mashiro brought several types of underwear for me to try on.
　Using the changing cover, I tried them on. Looking at myself in the mirror, I felt nothing. But when Mashiro rudely peeked into the changing room and saw me in the underwear, I distinctly felt shame being stoked within me.
After repeating this several times, she said, "This is the last one," and handed me two pieces of underwear.

A cute one in pastel pink.
A sheer black one.

"Hey,"

I gave the black one a sidelong glance and said to Mashiro, who held it with a smile.

"Mashiro, you're hopelessly pervy, aren't you?"
"Well, yes. Perhaps I am."

Mashiro, having resigned herself to it, didn't break her smile.
I could sense her strong determination that no matter what I said, I absolutely had to wear these two.

"This is the last one, after all."
　Saying that, I took both items and re-entered the fitting room.

First, the pastel pink one.
A bra with ample coverage, not overly large but certainly not small, fitting my bust well.
Looking in the mirror, I honestly thought this underwear was cute.

"Well? What do you think, Amamiya-san?"
"Hmph. D-don't peek like that right away!"
"Eh? It's incredibly cute. Pink suits you surprisingly well, Amamiya-san."
"H-///"

I couldn't say anything because I found it surprising myself.
Truthfully, I'd never kept pink things close to me. White or black. Occasionally blue tones.
I'd decided it was a colour scheme that didn't suit me, but it wasn't bad at all.
...No, perhaps since I started interacting with Mashiro, I've 'come to suit' colours like this too.

　Realising this, my face inexplicably flushed.
Seeing myself in the mirror, hugging myself bashfully, made my face burn even hotter.

Next, the sheer black one.
As I tried to remove the pastel pink one, my hand stopped.

"Hey, could you close the curtains?"

Saying this to Mashiro, who kept her face peeking out, she smiled and said, "Don't mind me."
　Without a word, I pushed her aside and closed the curtains.
I removed my bra.
Clip it onto the hanger, then stare intently at the black one. Observe it.

At that moment, I was definitely caught off guard.
My upper body was completely bare, and slouching around like that certainly hadn't helped.

But it was certainly true that Mashiro was the worst for peeking without properly checking with the person inside first.

"Well? How about the sexy one?"

Saying that, Mashiro peeks in without waiting for my reply.

"~~~~~!?//////"

Instinctively, I cover my nipples with my arm.
But whether I managed it in time is something only Mashiro knows.
　D-did she see?

A wave of shame unlike anything before washed over me.
My eyes welling up with embarrassment, I glared fiercely at Mashiro.

"Pervert!"

Utterly unfazed by my insult, Mashiro had the nerve to offer her opinion on the current situation.

"Hand-bra, eh? Well, that's rather naughty of you, Amamiya-san."
"Pervert!!!"

I grabbed Mashiro's face, which continued to stare intently at me, and shoved her forcefully away.

Mashiro really is naughty. A pervert. A total pervert.

Even after properly putting on the black underwear, my mood didn't improve much.

"Sexy stuff really suits you, Miss Amamiya."

Hearing that, I brusquely glance at the mirror.
………I felt the pink one was far better.
But well, this one isn't… bad?

"I'll buy both of these."
"Eh?"
"Hm? What is it?"
"Aren't I supposed to choose one last?"
"No. Both were good, so I'm buying both."

I couldn't stand Mashiro's smug expression as she declared this.
My face still hadn't cooled down...

"And this really is the last thing."
"What? There's more? I'm not trying any more on, honestly."

I cut her off before she could show me the item she'd likely been hiding behind her back.
A promise is a promise. I had no intention of wearing anything else.

Until she showed me this.

"This, well..."

Her beaming expression vanished instantly. Mashiro shyly showed me "it", suddenly studying my reaction.
What she held was the pink, fluffy, cat-eared loungewear I'd called "cute".

"Eh? Why that?"
"I think something that Amamiya-san shows interest in herself is far more important than Amamiya-san realises. I think it's something you have to treasure."

Mashiro spoke with a serious expression.
It doesn't really matter, though. Why does she talk as if she knows me better than I know myself—

"I don't really want it."

That's a lie. The truth is, I don't know.
　Do I actually want this? True, I couldn't take my eyes off it. I instinctively felt it was cute. That feeling itself is rare, it's true.
But if asked whether I want it, I don't know.

"Even if you don't feel that way right now, Amamiya-san. I absolutely want to buy this for you."
"Why is that?"
"Because it proves you do have a properly girlish sensibility. It would be such a waste to forget about it if we didn't buy it here and now."

Mashiro smiled.

Ah, it was warm.
She occasionally showed me this smile that wrapped my heart in a cosy warmth.

When she showed me that, my heart stirred without me knowing why.
I let my guard down around her.

"......"

If I said anything now, I might slip up.

　I silently accepted it and closed the fitting room curtain once more.

Wrapped up in fluffy layers before the mirror, I pondered with my head feeling all warm and fuzzy.
……….
My normal thought processes had ceased to function. I suppose I'm weak to her kindness.
But, if it's true that Mashiro likes me...
I suppose I wouldn't mind doing her this one favour, the first and probably last.

My face flushed, I was contemplating something I'd later regret and agonise over.
I pulled on the hood with cat ears.

"Mashiro, I've changed."

Saying only that, I waited for her to peek out.

"Well, what do you think?"

I turned my back to Mashiro as she looked out.
Our eyes met through the mirror.
　In a gesture I'd never done before – the moe sleeves – I brought both hands to the sides of my face.
My head felt like it was boiling.
I was so embarrassed my vision blurred.
Even so, for this moment only, I concentrated on my signature poker face.
Pretending to be expressionless, I looked at Mashiro through the mirror and said one word.

"Meow..."
